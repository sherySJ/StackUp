Akashdeep Das,Muchhh better app than tinder
Demario Bolden,Better than Tinder
Bill Holmes,Literally as bad as Tinder. I don't understand how these companies think monetizing every little aspect of their app is going to have a good impact on their reputation. In response to the reply. You people literally took free features and put them behind a paywall. You might be able to justify your greed in your mind. But we see right through it. You don't deserve 1 star but we're not allowed to give less.
Just,"Let's me swipe 4 people. Doesn't matter when I turn the app on or what my filters are set to, get to swipe a few times and then ""I've hit the end of the road today!"". Even tinder gives you 25 swipes twice a day. Timed resets. This is a waste of space. Further I can speak to any of my matches, so they all just time out because there's very few active users."
Urvi Shah,"My suggestion to you would be to remove the friends & bizz section. In the name of bizz, your app is misleading people. On one hand you promise to help network with business-minded people, but on the other-hand I'm not allowed to put-up my business handle in my bio ? What kind of hypocrites are developing this app ? Could your ""BIZZ"" section be more fake ? Tinder's far better, atleast they don't mislead people with pointless features like yours."
harsh jethani,If you are not going to show me the profiles of my matches I am gonna download Tinder
Dylan Jeter,"I didn't think it was even possible to make a dating app worse than Tinder... But you guys managed to do it. I deleted it... For one, the app is FAR too money hungry and hides every single feature behind a paywall. They advertise the app as the dating app that's made to be deleted, but I feel they need to reevaluate that line. I got more likes on my first day or two on the app, then the app started trying to encourage me to pay for premium. Upon declining, I've pretty much quit getting likes."
Magasinet Sundhed,"Very disappointed that spotlight did not work and then the app even says after having spent all this money on spotlight, that it was a success! I do like on Tinder that spotlight at least allows to continue swiping or that I can see in the corner the hearts with profiles that saw me. This Bumble spotlight is just money out off the window, absolutely no sign that I received anything for my money"
Tory Harmon,"This company is insulting. The price for super likes arbitrarily doubles then returns to normal cost, seemingly at random. The entire super like system feels like a scam, as I've sent dozens and dozens over the years and magically have never matched with anyone I've super liked. I also match with people I don't recognize and see the same people repeatedly. It's especially frustrating when I've spent money on likes then see the same person again the next day. This app has devolved into tinder."
Mitchell,"It takes 24 hours for likes to reset, there's no timer, and you only get 10 free swipes. Absolutely useless app. This used to be so much better than Tinder a few years ago and then they removed all the free features and it's terrible now."
Kelsie Webb,Wasted so much money on this app just to get banned for no reason it's a joke. Total waste of money like tinder don't recommend it
Kripya Laugh,Better than tinder
Dillan Brinlee,"Just wanted to update this since I tried it again, and it's still terrible. Worse than tinder and that's saying a lot. Very few features unless you subscribe and I'm pretty sure they just don't show your profile to people unless you pay. The first few days after making a profile I got lots of likes, then nothing for months. I'm sure bumble's response will be something like ""Try giving us your money!"" 🙄 If the free experience wasn't so frustrating, I'd have tried a sub instead of deleting."
Randy Roach,This a terrible app you literally only get 6 likes a day unless you pay $20 for premium!! $20 for a dating app that gives no more details to a person's profile then tinder does??? What a rip-off
Eric M,The app itself is fine but all the girls on it are cookie cutter copy paste no one unique all normies. If you are looking for someone who is like everyone else found the right place. Heck even tinder has more interesting people. Plus you can sort by people who have similar tags here you can not.
Benjamin Wright,Ever since they publicly listed as a company it has become tinder with yellow trim. Same bs tactics same bs money grab. Avoid.
A,So I'll usually do the bumble where u can look for the day to see your...and it never works when u wanna pay with a card...Google pay only seem to work...the app stared off good but has since just went downhill. Like if u do match u guys have to pretty much 24hour to respond or chat even tinder is not this bad. Id say use tinder instead. This app has wayyy to many errors. I always find it odd i Match with someone the day after my week subscription ends. Probably a fake profile bumble made🤔🤥$
Hardev Parmar,Trash as tinder
Tristin Barnes,"Sadly to say, I've also downloaded this app as well as Tinder, we need better dating apps, and there's gotta be a way to keep these bots off the dating apps, maybe put up a fire wall for bots people who are not real, also you need to do something about these high subscriptions you guys are making us pay, something must be done asap, you guys say your the #1 dating app, so then show us that you are what you say you are."
Ilya Schreiber,"Great app, better than tinder!"
Jake Jayne,"This app use to be a great experience, dated a girl from this app and met a lot of great women on here. No idea what happened but the algorithm changed to make you want to spend money, basically making a ""pay to win"" dating app worse then tinder. The women are leaving too, last time I tried it, I ran out of people to like very fast. Don't waste your time..."
Chris Conner,got blocked for no good reason. the support basically just told me to eat a dick. trash app. my gf got banned too and she got no help either. not that it's hard to make a new account to get around it. also you only get like 20 likes a day and no super likes so its not even as good as tinder 😂
Jakub Luptak,"Limiting organic matches as much as Tinder (ie not showing you the people that liked you as priority, used to in the past!), but the general idea of women communicating first is nice and empowering"
Shardul Singh,Way better than Tinder tbh. Although problem of bots still exists
Tyler Smith,"Algorithm is awful now, I get 5-10 matches a day on tinder but since bumble updated I've got a total of 3 matches in 3 weeks with the same profile. Don't waste your time, if you're not paying for the app they don't show your profile to anyone decent."
Jon Johnson,"I thought the app experience was modern and fine. All dating apps seem to have a pay wall now. I had more success with bumble recently than I have had with okcupid, and tinder. Even the quality of the matches and dates were better. I ended up deleting the app, because my experience is that I'm matching with people who aren't initiating or maintaining a conversation beyond the first ""hello""."
saurabh mishra,"Bumble is much better then oregr dating apps if you compare the crowd, also less people here looking for insta followers then tinder. 😂 it could be much better if bumble also seperate the casual and serious ones so that people with same expectations can meet easily."
Zer,"Literally cant even use it. I uploaded all my photos and kept saying "" lets try one just of you"". Literally even zoomed in my face and still cant even accept ANY of my photos. I even spent money on super swipe. Useless app and developers. Dont waste your money or time on this garbage,unusable app, tinder is better."
Yousuf Ibrahim,Prices r a bit expensive considered to tinder
Bart Van Eeuwen,Better than Tinder so far!
Prabhjot Kang,"Useless app i m mad taken premium wasted my money , more better apps is tinder ...I will never ever recommend this third class application ...."
GabrielStudios1000,"App is progressively getting worse. Just read the reviews. Bumble has a pathetic response everytime like something a call center would tell you. ""Our teams will take that into consideration"" . Lol at least have some shame and don't reply to your angry users on your declining app. Don't waste your time. I rather install tinder"
Mike Salmon,"I prefer this app over Tinder because women have to post a clear picture of their face. I always report the profiles that wear a mask or its not a clear photo. Otherwise, this app becomes like Tinder, and you get women that only have pictures of cats, food, or places they traveled to. I don't know why Tinder has allowed itself to become trash. Anyways, as soon as Bumble allows users to post only masked pictures, I'm out."
Florofila,"Well I agree with the rest of the comments, but a massive failure is filtering by location, you can select people in a radius of 100km but it will show people in another city way over the filtered distance for example, you are living in Sydney filter for 100km and it'll show people living in Brisbane, but it will say ""this user is 38km from your city's location"" lol also, Bumble doesn't deactivate inactive accounts like tinder, so clearly a waste of time, not worth to pay for a membership."
JD Cheramie,"Tried to join. Wouldn't let me upload photos. Welp, back to tinder, cuz I can't even set the account up."
Fredrik Hallin,"Tinder copy with few users, yet they think they can charge almost as much for the slightest chance to stand out. If you want to charge guys 80$ for a membership when we can't write, we're not gonna use your app."
Essley Green,App just stopped working. Couldn't use my bumble premium. Cant update my payment plan. Dont know what happened but it's sad because it was better than tinder until now. Do not use until they update their app. Again
Josh,"Found a lot more success then in tinder, better set-up app as well."
Tom,"You'd think the 150 min spotlight would bring people in, but it barely does anything. Even tinder works better and that's only 30 mins. Everytime your subscription has ended they say you're out of likes instantly in hopes you buy again. This app is trash."
Syed Fahad,Totally genuine n far better then tinder
Chris Williamson,It's better than Tinder on pricing. You can get a one day or one week pass also... (MAJOR WIN). What I also like is if women are genuinely interested they will make the first move & unlike Tinder there isn't a ton of scam profiles that I've seen. I give 4 stars and not 5 bc of having to wait 24 hours to be able to swipe again once you run out of likes. Change that and it is the best dating app.
Jordan P,"My bumble have been close for more than 48 hours with the message "" you have hit the end of the line for today, upgrade "" I get just 5 - 10 likes, and then this message appears again. This feature is bad, and for the first time for months i think i will go back to tinder or okcupid."
B B,"I've had a better experience on Craigslist before they took away Casual Encounters. Why did I even try this app? Just because I'm banned from Tinder, which is just as bad as Bumble. Don't bother replying to this review Bumble. We all hate you."
vipin kumar,Got 3-4 likes while free. After upgrading to premium and paying ₹5k getting no likes. Swiped around 2k profofiles but no luck. Fake app. Only extracting money. Remove ladies first feature.. Till date got only two likes but no messages.. Worst app ever... Use happn or tinder...
Mr Robot,Why can't you show how much time is remaining untill we can start swiping again?? Also reduce the wait time to 12 hrs atleast. Tinder is way better in these things.
Steven,"I like that the pressure is taken off of guys to make the first move. The dating market allows for women to generally be more selective about matches, so it's nice to have a system that guarantees that a match is going to actually be interested. I think the interface is much more thorough than Tinder, with the ability to look at full photos and have more in-depth bio information. I also think the prompts provided for potential matches is a great icebreaking feature."
Sidney Raats,"Same as tinder, only the userbase is a little better"
It's a Me,"This app has continued to take away basic functions and hide them behind an ever increasing paywall. You can't see your likes, okay fine, $14 a month. Also, you won't be seen unless you're spotlighted, but now it's $19 a month and that give you a few days. Oh, you ran out of likes, by the way the fee is now $30 a month and you still have limited amount of ""likes"" but you can always buy more. This was once a decent non-threatening way to meet people, it's clearly become only a cash cow. You're better off with OKC or Tinder again now, even with their history of bots. (bumble has them too)"
Anthony Moran,"The app used to be good you had unlimited likes and 3 chances to backtrack, which was all part of the free app which set it apart from tinder. Now you only get around 10 likes and no backtrack, they clearly just want you to pay for the premium to use the app."
Nemanja Vuletic,Nice app. Here you actually get to match ( unlike Tinder).
Kameron Diaz,When this app first came out it was similar to tinder. Could talk and chat and do a lot for free but now it's a pay wall. Wish it would go back to the way it was. I used it a lot more than Tinder too back then
Andreas Meyer,Better than Tinder
RapidFire1050 Gaming,"Worst and FAKE APP, TINDER IS best app. NO Matches for Guys or Girls. Everyone Uninstall it at once and save your time."
Tribhav Sharda,Tinder is better After Reading all the comments I am really scared to buy anything from this app
Tyler King,Feels like they've halved the amount of likes you get. Is almost as bad as tinder in terms of price point and quality.
questof1,"Almost worse than tinder. Get a match once a month. What is the point. I also feel that the ""people"" that match with you are either fake bots or people that work for the company to string you along when there are no matches. Apps like these are for shallow wanna be models."
Boyka NAYUM,Perfect dating app better than tinder
BW,"Gave this app another chance and it was the same as the last couple times. It will say you have likes, then you can expand search to literally everyone and anyone, they then disappear or never grt shown to you until you pay, which they then just disappear. They used to be good but become $ driven. Heck you'd have a better chance of honesty from tinder, don't wast your time or money."
DecimateTheWeak100,"Still no luck here. Mostly swiping right to see if theres real people on there. I'm convinced at this point Bumble/tinder use combo of ai/algorithms to comb social media of women, grab pics & make fake profiles. Any profile with a ig name I dm. Not 1 response. Even profiles that say ""not here much, dm on insta"". Even with matches i extend 2 48 hours, no response. Bad recent development, apparently Bumble just tosses matches. I get notif'd of match and see nothing when I check. Still no dark mode"
Abhay Gupta,Tinder is better
Tiago Viana,"Great app, dunno why... But iv been using ""uncussessfully"" tinder for a long time and gotta say. Bumble works way better for me :)"
Roberto T,"Not as bad as tinder but pretty much the same thing, just now for a guy not to make the first move. In the end everyone just links there ig account."
Elliot Kennedy,"Cash Grabs at Every Turn. Bumble passes up no chance to try to make money off of you, and somehow manages to provide an even worse user experience than tinder. Swipe limits are a joke and the apps user base is limited and dwindling. Care about your users more and stop trying to advertise so much. More people will use your app if you make it better, not if you keep advertising. Also, stop replying to every review with the same stupid scripted reply, we know all you care about is profit."
Erwin Rossen,"It's identical to Tinder. There is an endless supply of profiles, most of them without any information about themselves, and you have to swipe them left or right based on hardly anything. After sweeping a couple of thousand profiles, you might have a match."
Jag Samra,"This app is alarming sexist against men & women dont know how to conversate. UPDATE: App is still trash and biased against men, you're telling me girls can post their asses and cleavage all over their profile but I put up one shirtless pic and get moderated? Lmao this app is worse than Tinder and that's really sad"
Brendan Williams,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! Terrible app. Tinder and Hinge provide WAY more matches. No wonder Bumble stock is a dumpster fire.
ivan clark,Money Scam just like TINDER
Ibr Shivaz,this app is a Tinder rip-off. have fewer candidates. the configurations are a bit difficult. the SuperLike button should be moved to another part of the screen because people keep pressing SuperLike by mistake while swiping.
Emile B,"Low swipe limit. When u get matched the girls never message you and its rare to get any likes but i get frequent likes and matches on tinder, yubo etc."
Mustafizur Sarkar,"I had a bad day and came to read the 1 🌟 ratings from frustrated Singles of India. 🤣🤣🤣 Bumble, just ignore the 1 star ratings like Tinder."
James Hoagland,It's Tinder but worst
Roll Boy,A pale shadow of Tinder (wich is also not so great with hes algorithm) with absurd rules even for payed users consider rethinking your approach to dating if you are taking people's time and money
HighDollaSign,Got banned for no reason. No appeals allowed? Just like tinder. Straight garbage. This app is worthless. You should try to meet people in the real world. Met plenty of people through the app. Nothing worthwhile. People who turn to technology to meet others are out of touch anyway. You'll make more lasting connections when you meet someone in person for the first time.
Hello Bryan,"CALL YOUR BANK/CREDIT CARD. ASK THEM TO ""DISPUTE"" YOUR CHARGE. Update: Your business was blantantly stolen from Tinder, its premise inherently does not function, and your stock sucks. I don't use your app - I'm just enlightening all the users your company has ripped off."
David Carrega,"Tinder for adults seeking actual relationships. Edit: Expired matches disappear in your inbox after a week, even if you're premium. I travel for work, and I am often unable to check Bumble for weeks at a time. I question whether premium is worth it at this point. I used to rematch with expired connections. Now I can't."
Zachary Christianson,No worse off than tinder. The biggest perk is the ease of the user interface and how this app actually respects your choices for your filters. I don't constantly get matches from people in states I won't frequent on the regular.
Michael Davis,"Much better than tinder, you actually get to build a profile"
Ray h,"Good idea, bad app. Made to make try and get users to buy premium upgrades. Get a like and doesn't show up in the first few swipes, you won't ever seem to be able to find them no matter how many people you swipe through. Limited extends on the unpaid option. The ratio of women to men is so skewed that either as a man you'll have very few matches or as a woman you'll be so overwhelmed by matches you will never be able to message most. Also seems to be a ton of fake profiles that are obvious to any normal person but to keep their user numbers up for whatever ad sales they have they keep them up and do nothing to remove them. Basically tinder with more steps"
Secret!!! Guess what,"Got blocked after reporting 4-5 obviously fake profiles. Isn't it weird that some matches never reply? Some matches disappear unrealistically single and just on the app besides having many followers? Isnt it weird that without being reported or getting a match u still get blocked without having a single rule broken from their so called by lawss 😂😅🤣? Maybe this app is designed for simply torturing the single ppl? I think tinder is far far superior and best. Fyi they block the ip addresses, 😂"
Shadi Alblaawe,It's not bad! I mean similar to tinder but here you don't pay you don't get! And if you swipe without paying you will get like 10 swipes otherwise you have to pay so it's not worth it
Jakk Arson,Fake profiles created by Bumble to get you to use your limit of 5 likes a day. A scam to get you to pay for a membership. Bumble was good before they got greedy and becoming more like Tinder. You see Tinder makes a change then Bumble follows. You want to be the better dating app? Be the better person too.
Gabriel G,"Despite what developers claim, functionality is lost behind paying. You're eventually forced to verify which I didn't want to do out off principle. So bye bye bumble. Creates false scarcity in limited matches. Shame that mobile apps have gone this route in general, tinder, Duolingo, game apps. All with time limiters for no reason but to squeeze you for money."
Harlee,I have the same acount on Tinder and Bumble and Tinder gets me like twenty times the amount of matches. Bumble is also the most greedy app I've ever seen. They want you to pay for every little thing. They can suck it.
Nathan D,"Hi Bumble! It would be great to filter for people by pronoun/orientation. Also, having some larger travel mode regions to swipe in would be excellent, sort of like Tinder's global swipe option. For instance, I think the EU should be a swipeable region. You've formed a large consumer base of people who left Tinder due to overly strict bans -- capitalize on Tinder's mistakes and introduce more detailed filters to help serious customers. More tools, not more strictness/bans that hurt buyers. 🤗"
Alexander Keefe,"I didn't think it was possible to dislike the experience of using a dating app more than Tinder and yet here we are 1. It won't save edits I make to my profile, and crops photos that I didn't want to be cropped 2. it won't let you choose your own photos. It repeatedly popped up an error saying I needed to choose a clear photo of myself. It was a clear photo of my face so their image detection doesn't work"
Nitesh Kumar,"1 year ago, the app was good. Got so many likes and that too on free account. Now, I purchased premium membership, spotlight but all in vain. Hardly got few likes. Thumbs down. Seems tinder to be a better option."
Praveen Kumar,Unless you pay it is of no use. To see your match you need to pay so what is the use of giving a free version. At least tinder will allow you to see your matches and chat with them. The purpose of this app fails if you ask them to pay for it's intended usage.
Anindo Chatterjee,discount tinder 😂 a pathetic excuse for UI and UX and a wonderland for fake profiles
Filippo Chiassarini,"Useless app. It is poorly used in my country and girls are too picky. Matches happen only once in a lifetime, too rarely. Moreover, even if you get a match, girls don't even start a conversation. The problem here is the app concept: girls are really bad with pick up lines and they don't want to make the first move. In addition to that, even if you pay a subscription with unlimited likes you still get no matches. It's more a scam than an app. Actually, it's like tinder, a waste of time."
Jake,Somehow worse than tinder
vkjain007,Pathetic dating app i have ever seen ..No match till now from last 2 months and not had a single match ..And i had 10++ matches in Tinder dating app in last 1 month and on happn app 12 matches in one match .. Seriously 👎 a big zero (0) to the founder and the software developer and not having the swipeable right is active everyday ..
Roujin,"Pointless. Women don't want to make the first move (as stated on multiple women's profiles where they are asking for people to hit them up), and it still requires that both parties match first. So it's like Tinder if there was an extra wall before you can chat with someone."
Anujit Samadder,All ugly girls are here I searched for like 19 minutes and I only found unattractive girls which is very disappointing for me . I think I should switch to tinder again
Sheila May Macaroncio,My ex I met in bumble cheated on me with a cheap girl on Tinder.
Isaac Lujan,Show you that there is a match to try to make you pay... same creator as tinder they are rip offs
Mbackeh Jabbi,Great app. Better than tinder
Amber Dowling,"The overwhelming amount of complaints about the price of your premium service really shows something here. Hinge charges half the price you do and tinder has constant sales for premium. Your app is the best in terms of features but the price for premium, which some actually would like to use, is beyond outrageous. At least have a sale every once in a while"
CameraSet Action,"Not a single match . I've been using bumble for years and I have 300+ matches on Tinder, however I cannot get a single match on bumble. Which sucks because I find the girls to be much better on this app."
Jordan Pease,"This app went from being better than Tinder to being purely a cash grab. WAY less likes than you used to get, constant barrage of ads to get premium, they literally removed a feature that was free and make it premium only (being able to reswipe on someone you just swiped on), and many more. Do not bother."
Jay Thakkar,Thousand Times Better than Tinder
Matt Peddie,Poorly optimised and a blatant copy of tinder.
Jaerrod/Foster Halstead,App is good. Just like Tinder but different at the same time.
Sidionian,"Bumble is pathetic Feminist, sexist garbage. Bans exist just for being reported. And you can get reported for anything, even if no proof exists or it's just he-said she-said. If you delete a match, that person can report you just out of spite for deleting them. Absolutely disgusting, politically correct, gynocentric rubbish. Bumbe and Tinder should learn from other dating apps, where reporting someone needs to be accompanied by EVIDENCE! (Screenshots or Conversation archive etc.)"
Ross Pound,The concept of women go first is a great plan. But unfortunately I haven't found the one on here nor Tinder and anyone else I have a suspicion that girls on here just love to use the matchmaking as a doll collection and some accounts on here are fake or a mock up otherwise I would of given a perfect 5 if that was fixed
Varun Awasthi,Nice app but only only problem males can't start chatting like Tinder.
Crystal Champeau-Williams,"First they took away option to backtrack if you accidentally swipe left on someone, now you can't filter results without subscribing so I'm shown lots of guys who im not interested in. Would love to see bio and question answers required. Right now, it's basically tinder without both people being able to message first. People just post pics with little to no other info supplied. Not helpful for those looking for true relationships and not hookups.App has become my least likely dating app to use"
Christian skaggs,Better than tinder
Olivia Lane,"Bumble sucks so much. Never any matches, and if I get one they never respond.. low quality of people on here. Tinder is surprisingly better."
Tushar Rathod,"Tinder wins even after buying premium of bumble i got no match i realised its waste of money & time, thought it could be more better but just waste."
Tyler Shanley,"Used to be decent however has become entirely ""pay to win"" like tinder. The super likes used to get a decent response rate and now they don't work at all....."
Bono Bailey,Disgusting app. They have people just like tinder working for em who match up. They con you into paying then ban you without any reason whatsoever. Please avoid at all costs and I'll be making sure everyone knows. No customer service to speak of. Complete rip off
Blessing Ankra,"Stupid app, gets worsen every year. 1 Star wouldn't have being an option for me, a better ranting would have being 0 star if there was an option for that. How can bumble just logout someone without non of their rules violated? just for reaching limited likes for the day the next day bumble get you logout rubbish! Tinder is still far better than this app."
Jeff Pierce,"Pay to win tinder for snobs. I regret paying for the mid tier subscription. Most everything is still behind a paywall. Bumble advertised in app that if I upgraded and paid even more I would get 18x more matches. What a blatant money grab. App notifications work but the app never updates unless closed and reopened. I love the concept of bumble, just hate the app and subscription structure. Edit: I lowered my rating due to copy/paste review response from bumble."
Vladimirs Kacs,"So much better than Tinder or Badoo, despite the smaller user base."
Wasim Ansari,This app is better than tinder
Rachit Chaudhary,"I would say that Bumble is still better than Tinder. Intention focused dating app, a UI with a tad bit less focus on photos in comparison to Tinder and a bit wholesome bios. Overall what all the dating apps lack in general is interaction between users. Let them get a taste of the person they like and charge them once they're hooked. Who's going to pay for uncertainty? Or you can hire me as product manager, I can help."
Julian King,Better than tinder 100% no fake accounts. That I've run into yet.
Pass Kall,"GARBAGE. HIDES YOUR MATCHES FROM YOU UNTIL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION RUNS OUT. AND MR. BUMBLE, BEFORE YOU ANSWER, ALL OF THOSE HIDDEN MATCHES WERE 100% WITHIN MY PARAMETERS. THE *DAY* MY SUBSCRIPTION RUNS OUT THE MATCHES START ROLLING IN. TOTAL SCAM!!!!!! WRITING IN CAPS SO EVERYONE SEES THIS. MORE CORRUPT THAN TINDER 🤮🤢🤑💰🖕"
sergio de la vega,Boring. Youll have more fun on tinder
Kyle Young,"Fake likes, you get multiple likes go and check and it's one then go look again a few hours later it's none and it repeats just keeping you coming back. £3 a day ? What a joke. Never mathes no matter how many profiles you like. Rather use tinder"
Aman Gupta,Tinder give 5 super like every month for free and 1 spotlight every month. Why don't you make your app too be good as tinder.
ernestsolos,"I purchased 5 superlikes for 299 rupees. OTP came for the eame but it deducted 1300 rupees. Tried contacting bumble, they didn't even respond. Tinder is way better. I have 40 likes without buying any premium service. Here I have just 1 after spending 1300 rupees. I'm actually going to consumer forum now. This app needs to be closed now!!"
Moustafa Naasan,"I'm not getting any matches! Of course it's not the best experience, it's the worst! You should even remove time extending option to let women respond in time, otherwise no one will respond as they (women) usually get more crushes due to most of men are looking for sex, sorry for being honest but that's the tragic truth! And if you don't do anything about it, your app will be no more than tinder or happn because all of them have the samen problem 😞"
Kyle Sullivan,Terrible and basically same app as Tinder with same horrid paywall to use basic functions like messaging or liking others. I understand why people still use apps like Grindr etc.
Edgar Davey,I like this app more then tinder. It's more honest and feels more human. Unfortunately in my country not many ladies use it. Otherwise I love the features such as BFF search. Seems like girls on Bumble are a bit more conscious then in tinder
Shiladitya Pal,"Worst experience ever. Not getting matches even after getting the premium. In this regards, tinder is way better. Atleast it will give you matches if you purchase their premium membership."
Pasithea Paradise,"They used to give 2 advanced filters for free. No more! You have to pay to see people similar to you. Also you get maybe 10 right swipes a day and that is it. This app is not free, it's a joke. Heck no I will not do any free trials!!! No one wants to pay for this b s. Seriously. I'll go back to using tinder and just put friends only in my bio. Bumble has become an actual joke now. Scammers left and right. Seriously w t f you guys."
Shivin Dhariwal,Still better than tinder
Mauricio Silva,This app is an absolute scam. Is it time for Bumble to get the same class action lawsuit as tinder? It's clear the app is filled with fake profiles to make you think you can get a quality match. All the attractive people that look worth awhile never write a 1st message. Total piece of 💩 They get you by thinking you have a bunch of likes adding up. Only when you buy premium those likes still don't give you an opportunity to match. They just stay blurred out even after increasing distance & age
Martand Pratap Singh,Do not subscribe. Tinder is much better . If you forget to cancel the subscription they will take the money and won't even give you back after request. Highly unprofessional
Matt R,Good luck get matches without paying. What a joke. Might actually be worse than tinder
Eshan Ghose,"Bumble is GOOD. Much better than Tinder, in my opinion. And their customer service is top notch. I had a problem, so I contacted Bumble Support on Twitter. Not only did they respond promptly but they also understood my problem and fixed it within a few hours. Would definitely recommend!"
Keaton Ullah,"Can't login because my numbers been blocked. It's a new phone and I was not blocked, and I say yall should use Tinder only because you can login everywhere. These other dating apps don't know how to use email for login. If someone gets blocked an someone takes there number, the number remains blocked. Tinder is the only one that hasn't done that to me because they use email for login and not number."
Mazi Nazi,It's a 100 times better than Tinder
Kelly Barnes,Deleted day after download have to pay to be able to use properly. Your better off with pof and tinder also badoo. Can do way more on them.
Panda N,This app is actually bad. I got almost 30 likes after creating my profile but i got no even 1 match after swipe right all profile. They want to push you buy premium to get match LOL. And premium is more expensive than Tinder even this is worse.
Gareth Crawford,Its fair alot like tinder where they say you have like but never bring them up to match . So far my best experience has been with hinge its straight forward meet the person as they like your page . Non of this try match for 3 months running out of matches daily but yet never seeing the like.
Arif Bhuiyan,I think it's more usefull then Tinder.
Bob Poudrier,"I've spent hours trying to install this app, going through all the troubleshooting steps, while tinder and hinge installed very quickly."
Ex3 dR,You literally get just 8-10 free swipes now. There used to be a time when it was a good app and I chose thise over tinder. But now it sucks a big time. This app won't survive like this for any longer.
Israel Rangel,"This app used to be good for me, but now it's just a whole bunch of girls way out of my league so it feels like they're all fake profiles! I haven't had a match in ages on Bumble whereas I've had tons of CMB and even Tinder. What a waste"
Vijwal Akula,"Although I have a tough time getting matches, I would say this app is well designed, works well enough. I like the question prompts they have too. Overall, better than Tinder in every way except number of users. Otherwise perfect."
Mr Anonymous,The major dissatisfaction I have with this app is that I can't restrict my search to only include people within a preferred distance radius just as Tinder does it. I keep seeing profiles of people who are far away in distance than I prefer.
Douglas March,Tinder (ugh) has now blown past what used to be my favorite dating app. Now time to try something else. Bye forever.
Lena Valenzuela,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. I gave it 3 chances and not one dates. You waste time swiping and when you find a guy you like and you swipe right He is gone you never see him unless he is a match and there is no icon to message guys weather you match with them or not. I message them a lot about the time messages and nothing. They have 24 hours to contact you or poof they go away. They run a horrible algorithm Sometimes I get women in my matches nothing against Woman, but I am not into women. Also did the $30 a month tried it for 5 months nothing. The hives is the same thing. They only want money. All they tell you is fix your profile and nothing is wrong with my profile You are better off taking your chances with Match or Tinder at least you can message someone you like on there. They say woman make the move is a lie its not different then Tinder at least Tinder and other apps have a message button My advise avoid this dating app like you would the Covid 19. Trust me you will be single for a long time using this app. I had to give it 1 star because it would not let me give them no stars, but they deserve NO STARS."
James Leroux,"I'll get what I call, ""fasle matches"" people you match with and just don't say anything when the app clearly says you can't talk without them messaging first, funny part...even that function doesn't work because I've been able to message first every time if I chose too...also lots of spam bots....please make the accounts a bit longer to make like tinder does so people can't spam websites on your app"
Gabriel Avornicu,"Started out great, being more fun than Tinder and stuff, but after a while the app gets useless. Also great idea to let girls/women take the first step, but there is a time limit on it, which means both parties should be using the app pretty much every single day. That neutralised about five matches for me. The other two just didn't work out and after a while no matches appeared. // Good intentions of the creators, but in the and just a normal premium subscription-based app."
John Little,"Does what it says on the box, better than tinder, could do with a better price though"
Crested Saguaro,"Bumble is pretty good, but there's this dumb feature prevent you from adding ""mirror selfies"" to your profile. So far, all the people I've seen on the app are legit. I haven't run into scammers, bots or fake profiles using this app like when I used Tinder."
Kenneth Parks II,"Response to complaints are generic responses, they truly do not care in making the experience better. Send me to a fb page just for you to not do anything on there either? Was ok once a pretty decent app, now you get like 30 swipes for a whole day, cant block phone numbers like tinder, and want you to pay for subscriptions. Now a cash grab instead of a dating app. With the flood of negative reviews in such a short period, you would hope that you take heed and make some adequate changes...QUICKLY"
Ashleigh Muir,"Almost useless now they've crippled the number of free likes. Used to be bumble was actually unlimited but they now do even less than tinder, the amount per day seems to vary, but it's usually between 10-20. I don't expect a lot of matches, like one percent maybe. So that's 1-2 weeks of swiping to get 1 match, problem is most of the women you do match will not send a message anyway so start again. Used to be the better app but is now completely inferior."
Grzegorz Suwala,"Better than tinder, less commercial feeling, less collecting matches and more face-to-face meetings, it just works."
Mick o,bumble finally sold out... might as well call it Tinder 😅..
Stephanie Vazquez Rojas,It's way better than tinder!! If yall having trouble with it. Go email and ask for help. They can help you to fix it. Bumble works!
Jacob McCalpin,I used it a few years ago and loved it. Now it's changed a lot and you spend almost no time on the app unless you pay. Totally garbg Edit: thanks devs for responding. I think it would be more beneficial for your users to allow more time for engagement in the app. Tinder has a limit on the amount of likes you can use which allows the user to spend more time in the app. The influx of one star reviews for Bumble would indicate to me that users are not happy with the amount of time spent in Bumbl
Ryan,"Figured after a few months I would update my review. Bumble suffers from the same things Tinder does; too many scam accounts, no way of seeing when the person you're viewing was even last on, and constant adds despite the app still barely holding a connection. Edit: 2/22/2022. Not a single person have ever swiped on me the entire plus year I've used it. Not one. Yes thats depressing.Rates have gone up, as fast as the scammers accounts have. I'm done with this app."
Robert Chavez,"I have used several different apps and have had great success with all of the others except this one. I have never found any meaningful connection on here and most women will match only to not say anything. Will cancel my membership and go back to tinder, OK cupid hinge etc. Women on those apps actually want to talk and meet up."
Pritam Chavan,"I have no clue how this app finds you a match. Not a single match single last 3 years. I mean I don't understand who does the algorithm favors. Also tried the subscription for month, but unfortunately same results. Pathetic service. Tinder works far better than this. Please y'all should genuinely check your algorithm issues."
Jamie Mcleod,The app never works as it always tells me to update the app even though there isn't an update so deleted it now and going back to tinder
Symon Jefferson,Its been better than Tinder!
Commander WB,"I tried just about every dating app, and Bumble has been among the worst experiences I've had with online dating. I had very few matches on the app and can say with confidence it is a fault of Bumble and not my profile as an identical profile on Tinder and other apps had more successful matches. The 24 hour limit rarely has the desired impact of forcing communication, but often the opposite by guaranteeing a failure of communication. Also, very few profiles are available to see per day for free"
Kara Potter,"Trash app. Used to be good. Also. Way too expensive And to their comment below, you pretty much have to pay for it for your profile to be seen or to match with others. This used to be better than tinder but I actually think it's worse."
Austin K,It's absurd how few swipes you get. Like 10 every 24 hours. It's a shame because this app used to be better than tinder and all the rest but now it's just the same greedy bs. They'll get my money over my dead body.
Tiffany Henry,"Bumble is the safest platform for women to find love online. I seen a screenshot of the Bumble team emailing a victim of sexual assault after deleting the perpetrator's account. It was warm, kind, and they seem to genuinely care about our safety unlike Tinder and other dating applications. It was one of the many times I've witnessed them go above and beyond for people using the app to show appreciation or just to be good folks. Thank you for setting an example, Bumble! <3"
Vivek Venga,It's good if you're a minority living in Malaysia. Much less Malay hijab womens here compared Tinder. No offense to them.
Arthur Ricardo Veiga,enter then tinder
Isaac Darkstar,2 matches that haven't responded in the first week! This site is faster than Tinder!!!! 🤣😂 Edit: Still not a single match has connected with me.
Donovan Wilson,"This app was always awful, just like most dating apps are for guys. But throwing that ridiculous paywall in front of every single thing and severely limiting the number of swipes just makes it not even worth keeping as a time waster. How does it feel seeing your average rating worse than TINDER 😂."
Damian Snell,"Pure hypergamy 😄 The same fun nightmare that dating is on the other similar apps, like OKC & Tinder. Have met 2 people through Bumble in 2 months. I like that women must message first so that I don't waste my time crafting a clever opener for someone who isn't all that interested or just has a better option. The same lack of a sense of humour seems to pervade the community as it does with all the other dating apps *admins barred IP for reason ""we received complaints about this profile"""
rahul pradhan,"Better people than tinder but the ""women text first plus 24 hours to reply after they text"" idea is illogical. Not everyone can come online everyday and if we didn't want to talk, we wouldn't swipe right to begin with. Look into this, I have lost countless number of matches because either they or me didn't start the conversation within the given 24 hours timeframe. We can always unmatch if we don't like the person after getting matched."
Georg Plaz,"I really thought bumble honestly wanted to be the better date maker than tinder. The filters really worked to find your kind of people. I was enthusiastic about bumble, I even sometimes paid for stuff. But seeing how the features thaz made this app great are moved behind the pay-wall. It seems like bumble is just a greedy company after all. It makes Bumble just as useless as Tinder if you don't follow the pay-to-win model."
Keith,"I actually like the concept of Bumble, it really weeds out the women that are playing games and seeking attention. Less matches than Tinder, but better quality. I've met a few awesome girls on here so far and I'm not paying anything 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️. 4 to 2 starts.... I find it very annoying that woman can post half nude thong bikini pics, yet when I post a non-selfie non-bathroom shirt less pic it gets moderated. Also, every profile is woman advertising there social media, snap IG... So annoying."
Aoife Ni Riain,The app is better than tinder but could still have some improvements. I subscribed to one of the paid features for a week and it took me about 20 minutes to figure out how to cancel it. It is not made easy probably on purpose. I would like to see an app with a regular speed dating video option available. Trying to get to know someone on typed messages is painstaking.
Kane Sell,Good tinder band me
Nick M,The same owners to Tinder. It is a trash app that you shouldn't put time and money into
Gamegeared,After gutting all filter options for free users you ensured I would never consider premium. It was a good thing to prevent folks wasting time swiping on deal breakers. You want user engagement not user frustration. I'm probably dumping this app in the next month alongside tinder. I have far better ways to be disappointed.
Nice Try,"Bumble took away a lot of the free features they used to have, and now it's all for pay. I notice even the price of those went up as well. Guess corporate greed got to them. I think they even reduced the amount of swipes you get a day as well. I remember it being a lot more. What used to be the best dating app is now one of the worst. Even tinder is better. Or hinge. Delete or this trash and save yourself the time and get something else until they go back to what made them successful."
Simon Dragen,"In the world of online dating there developed a strange dynamic in which as a male you are perceived as generic, basic, and otherwise lame by women whom you communicate with. Just imagine as a woman who tries out tinder or p.o.f or match.. your first day you get off work and check your inbox and there's 50 messages that say ""hey"" ""I like your hair"" ""you're hot"" basically generic intro responses. Bumble makes this situation eleminated."
0. .0,"I want to give four stars. I could even give five. But I have some gripes. The premise is kind of amazing for its simple innovation. Putting the onus on women not only gives them a sense of security, it gives men marginally more assurance they're not throwing their time away. But it's a little frustrating to be presented with people based on present location rather than area of residence. Undermines the pros stated above (hookups are for Tinder). And Instagram integration is rekt."
Armin,"The experience is terrible. If you're not paying for the subscription, your profile gets exposure only to people that you may see in your stack of swipes. Once you get suckered into paying for the subscription to see the ""10 likes"" you've received, your profile stops getting exposure and than you don't receive anymore likes. This has happened to me countless times and I honestly think Bumble is running an humanless algorithm that racks in big $$$ on desperate human beings. Same goes for Tinder."
Nicholas Desaulniers,Good idea bad execution. 24 to 48 hours is not enough time for people to respond. I've had multiple swipes that all lead to nothing. No response. Even if I boosted by 24 hours. Are they bots? I don't know. I currently have one like and I swipe each day to get no like back. With okcupid and Tinder you an usually get a match quickly.
Cameron Ray,"Do not waste your time, effort, and money. They are like Tinder, they require you to pay to talk to your matches. This app is bad and is unreliable in many areas. They give you really good deals, at least that's what it looks like but when you click it it requires 30-90 dollars. This app is a huge scam. Do not trust the 5 start ratings, look at the 2-3 star, those are your real ratings. I will post this again incase this app tries to delete my post again for the fifth time."
justsomeguy,Much better than tinder! You have to answer a bunch of questions which helps you get to know someone. Kinda cool
Jean Luis Urena,Like 20 swipes and you're done for the day 😂. I'll stick to Tinder.
Brian O'Connell,Absolutely trash. None of the settings for who I want to see are followed. Getting profiles of people 50 to 100+ miles away when I have it set to 25 or less. Age range I gave up on and basically just opened up completely since it wasn't being followed either. I'd rather go back to endless fake profiles of tinder. I also hadn't used the app for months and all of a sudden saw a charge for 29.99 on my card for the subscription which I had canceled. Now there is nothing I can see to cancel it.
Lizette Valdovinos,Now when my matches run out i have to wait to tomorrow to get more? I go to tinder while I wait.
Oga Boga,Very poor moderation. Your account will get blocked and removed for ignoring messages. Full of weirdos. no better than Tinder minutes the poor customer service
Jeffrey Valiente,The problem with this app is the paywall. Tinder and other dating apps wont force you to pay. This is fine as a tandem app for any dating apps. Just dont rely too much. It will constantly remind you how lackluster the free usage of this app.
ImABee,Tinder 2 electric boogaloo
Un Available,Worse than tinder
Jakeb Lindsay,"Will permaban you for no reason. I've never met anyone in person on this app. I've never initiated sexual conversations. I don't send dirty pics. I'm guessing the last conversation i had with a woman on there, I told her I didn't want a relationship because my woman had passed away in 2020 and explained I wasn't ready. Everything I've read, if a woman reports you for ANYTHING you're banned for life. Stick with Tinder. You're better off."
Will Berry,"Seems Bumble has massively decreased the amount of likes you can get. That added to the removal of the 3 free undos, it's clear that they're trying to push you to pay for premium features. Used to be a much better alternative to Tinder, now it's just as bad. Avoid."
Edwin Devilas,I like bumble. Some of the people are as fickle like on Tinder. But still could use improvement. They could offer more incentives
Jacob,"Nice, way better than tinder and more male friendly, and of course as well female friendly, algorithm is way better, you see more people who actually liked you, the only thing that would be nice is for example, being able to add if youre vegetarian, vegan or none"
Matthew Overby,"Much better than tinder, and the spotify connection actually works, love the features, wouldn't say it's a hookup app at least not in my area, which is a plus"
Angel Attocknie,Tinder sucks but this is even worse with the servers and people on it too plus the amount of money it cost just for a month is horrid
Tega Biz,More matches than tinder
John Benner,Women message first in this app and only when there's a match. The added levels of safety for women on the app compared to other dating apps make it so they can reach out without as many issues as are on OKC or tinder. I find my time is far better spent on this app.
Harry Read,Good definitely better than tinder.
AJ CB,"It's a fun idea and decently put together, I don't feel like I have any trouble matching, my problem is the timer. Why on Earth would you put a direct limiting factor on your ability to match, and then worse, paywall the extensions? Obviously its for money, but what sense does it make for busy people to have to check the app every day just to make sure they don't miss a bite? For that reason it's a worse alternative to Tinder. Don't spend your money here, I doubt it'll help you."
Pintu Singh,The worst app to use. Can any of the developer or bumble team explain why there is a 24 hour window to send a message? I can understand why woman first but why 24 hours? I have missed so many matches due to this and when I met the same girls from Aisle/Tinder they told me they were not aware of it also mostly they stop notification during weekdays so they don't see any matches as they remain busy
Matthew Golder,Did away with the any kind sorting feature without paying an absurd amount of money. Basically tinder at this point
Chris Saxon,"This app sucks! Do not download. I've been on it once and uninstalling. The matching is pathetic, They chargefor everything including filters for matches, viewing likes that you may not even like, messaging. Stick with Tinder, Clover Chat, or Badoo. They're so much better."
Logan Shrader,Almost as bad as tinder
Ego Proxy,Never met anyone on here. Some women still expect you to message them first. It tries to make you pay to be able to message women. Very gimmicky idea. Literally anyone can message first expect for straight men. Once again just like tinder it tries to capitalize on straight men by making it harder for them. Men don't get this app. Don't waste your time.
Alaskan Whiskey,"Trash app. Literally have to pay high prices in order to even see your matches. Just as bad as tinder these days, I created a new tinder(never been banned) and got up to 104 matches in total and ended up getting a verification notification I had to do which didn't work of course so I'm pretty sure I was shadowbanned. These apps are useless. They take your hard earned money and when you become successful with the app they ban you and pocket the money. Note I am in thailand at the moment."
Oriana Morgan,Tedious with none of the benefit promised. Not any better than Tinder.
selvam swamykannu,Just been using for a week. So far I like Bumble. Definitely better than Tinder. Will update the review after few months of use
Brad Bird,"See many adverts for it, used it for well over a year, get no matches on it and the app constantly wants money, seriously you'd have more chances on tinder or if your fuglt like me, more chance in pub than this app seriously, worst dating app I've ever used."
Stanislav Marchevsky,"Much better experience than Badoo or Tinder. Love, when women write first :)"
Cleetus Hodson,"This app is even worse than tinder. Enough said really. Broken features, CONSTANT and blatantly FALSE advertising premium features, and annoying porn bots are all things to expect on an average visit to bumble. Oh and don't think you can start again by reseting your account lol, you will be shadowbanned, and the app will put you at the bottom of the pile. Bumble will also stop messages being sent from your profile to another. Of course they don't tell you this."
Omar Benrebouh,I'm pretty surprised by the high amount of low stars. The app is pretty well designed. There are things that need work though. I'm reading the negative comments and I'm laughing. It's an app. It's designed to make money. Duh. The $ structure did change and it's at a state where it's as greedy as tinder. I don't like that much but oh well. I'm a guy so by default I'll get less matches than women but I'm OK with that. I'd rather quality over quantity. Is there a way to give more feedback?
Dorian,"Better than tinder, nicer features, just less people for now, but I like it! :)"
Tai Y.,"They ruined their own app put of pure greed. Used to prefer this over tinder and hinge. Now it's easily the worst of the 3 and everything is locked behind a paywall. Don't waste your money on this junk. The crazy amount of negative reviews speaks for itself, I guess they just don't care."
Tom Broad,"Bumble was one of the best dating apps out last time I was single, higher quality prospects than POF on average, far fewer time wasted vs tinder. I understand this is capitalism and they want to make money, but the app is now barely functional unless you are willing to pay. The algorithm doesn't push the prospects who have already expressed interest in you to the front of your queue like POF and tinder do."
Mridul Meharia,"There's a cheapness to the app. The premium features are locked behind several steps and while paying, you're not immediately made aware of what you're not getting (coz we are used to apps like tinder) Additionally, they will tempt you to buy premium with practices like, purposely not matching you with someone who's liked you until you pay. I think the monetization scheme is what's making me give 1 Star"
M Duran,"The reality is every dating site has gone down hill. All apps have pay walls. The only thing that you should be looking for is which ones you can talk on for free. Bumble, POF, and Tinder are the only ones. This app is more Male friendly. Only women can send the first msg. And they only have 24 hours or poof, opportunity gone. Does away with the ""I will not msg 1st"" bs on other apps. So only non stuck up girls are on this one. I haven't paid and I'm talking with 2 right now so..."
Benjamin Moorman,"Tinder with the gimmick that only women can initiate contact. Somewhat useful in the past, but they've now locked vital filters (namely religion) behind a steeper paywall than I've seen in almost any other dating app. I struggle to understand why any man would bother. EDIT: The daily subscription remains a poor value, especially given the paucity of matches I'm actually interested in following removal of advanced filter options. I obviously could scroll through each match, tediously rejecting each one that a basic filter would have previously prevented me from wasting my time looking at, slowly crushing my will to keep wading through the soul-sucking,depressing slough of the swipe left/right model you use. But the field of online dating is a crowded one. I'd rather spend my time (and money) on apps and services which aren't decreasing their usefulness in a transparent attempt to drive up subs. Bumble was deleted the day I made my intial review."
Marinos Papadopoulos,It's good. A bit better than tinder. Needs more customers through
Buck Palmer,It's a garbage dating app! Don't ever use it. It's worse then tinder and that is saying alot.
Comrade Bobby,Worse than tinder.
TheodoreFocus,"Got moderated and no justifiable reason given. It wasn't my photos or they'd have been removed. It wasn't the content of my profile or it'd have been edited. It wasn't anything I said to my matches or they'd have just unmatched. Account deleted, poor review given. Perhaps Bumble need to review their policies. It's saying something when it has a poorer rating than Tinder."
Chad Englot,"Finally a site that is definitely worse than POF and Tinder. I actually didn't think it was possible! I guess that'll explain why so few women and matches in a city of 300,000. Bumble, you are a joke!"
Aseem Sameer,"This app is worse than tinder. You don't get relevant people either, but within just 15-20 swipes, it says you're done for the day. Tinder lets us swipe atleast 30-35 people. Disappointed and ofc, already stopped wasting my time with this dreadful app."
Michael Avery Rollins,"Had the account for several weeks, never got 1 like. Came across the same people on Tinder and immediately matched with them. Not only that, you're slowly but surely having to pay for everything. I don't recommend this app at all."
A Google user,Obviously sharing information throughout the dating app community..the app then doesn't work and no feedback just ignored another female orientated chauvinistic app that has no other intention other to steal your data money and information and pass it on..fake!! IN COHOOTS WITH BADOO BLENDR AND TINDER!! DO NOT USE!!!!
Eashan Deshmukh,Better than Tinder!
Ben Watson,"This app is quickly becoming a dumpster fire, and it's hard to say this : This app is far worse than even tinder. That says it all folks. Get out while you can."
Michael Freed,Just a tinder copycat where the only thing that matters is your first profile pic. It's extremely annoying that the app complete ignores my preferences. Half my suggested matches live out of state.
ahmed khaled,"I want to use something for dates but with free version and people this say is free version of tinder but what i saw is just another version of tinder , you can swip free but everything else is woth price even when someone like you , you have to pay to know about them just like tinder"
Robert Veric,Lame money grab worse than tinder (who is also money grab)
Thomas Francis,"This app is either a scam or broken. I've had people in my likes list for 4 months that still haven't shown up in my feed, and I've tried their bs subscriptions which they don't tell you auto renew so I ended up paying them for days without any notification they were charging me while I wasn't even active on the app. So if you enjoy wasting time and possibly money this is perfect for you, but otherwise you'd have a better chance finding a real connection with someone on tinder than you do here."
William Elliott,"Use Hinge instead. Bumble is owned by Tinder. And they're both horribly buggy. My friend worked for them for a few weeks and confirmed nobody knows what they're doing. Hence all the negative reviews. (How many popular apps do you see with this many bad reviews??) Luckily more and more people are switching to decent apps. I rarely hear people say ""Tinder"" or ""Bumble"" anymore. 5 years ago that's what people said when talking about dating apps. Now you hear ""Hinge"" most of the time in the real worl"
Jody Homewood,Better than Tinder as less fake accounts
Bacos Inc.,Worse than tinder
A Google user,"Bumble the only app asking us to update, without providing any update details. You want me to email and ask for info that you should provide for everyone up front? Now your latest update make the app just like Tinder. Abd Don't think we have forgotten your promise of free backtracks for life. Now you have reneged on changing a swipe error and expect us to pay$ not cool!"
David Anthes,"So far much better than tinder, which is mostly populated these days by scammers in one form or another. This is probably the best app if you're looking to actually meet up."
Leonardo King,Really enjoy this app as it takes the pressure off of me messaging. And I find more meaningful and respectful conversations than apps like tinder. People seem more mindful and bit more serious.
Baby Nirnroot,I'd like a new system for the cool down time to meat people not 24 hours or having to pay 19.99 a week that's ridiculous. Honestly if you have tinder just use that it's way better and you wait 7 hours instead of 24 when you run out of likes. Subscriptions are way cheaper and you can actually use a super like with out having to pay an exorbitant amount of money for one thing.
Mike Perks,"JUST A COMPLETE RIP OFF FOR MEN! In short, you'll appear high in women's searches for the first day or so then your profile will disappear in the abyss; unless you perpetually pay for spotlights and superswipes it's pretty much useless and begs the question what do premium membership fee actually provide? I've compared this side by side with Tinder using the sames pics & bio, truly shocking differences. If you want to flutter money away for a glimpse of attention, go to a strip club."
Rotimi Odetola,"Descent app, good alternative to others like hinge, tinder, etc."
Corey Baraniuk,"This dating platform is a joke. Horrible matches, if you get any. Waste of time. Nothing good out there anymore. I have better luck on tinder and Facebook dating."
David Lowe,Like the app but would be better if you could scroll the photos the same way Tinder does it.
Kya Wiley,Kinda lame. Better stick to tinder at this point.
Chiky Scares You,"I have had this app since 2019... Since then I have had only 3 matches... That's what I get in a day in tinder using the same pictures and the same bio description... Definitely not worth the time, especially because after the first message of 2 of those matches they never replied anything. Also, you only get 5 likes per day, which is absurdly ridiculous. ALSO, if someone ends the chat can you PLEASE not delete the chat history?"
ausdude009 ausdude009,"I was using the app happily for a few months until suddenly I couldn't log in any more. I had done nothing wrong yet my phone number became blocked, unable to access my account. Emails to customer service to find out what went wrong never received a reply. Don't bother with it. Update 3 - Still no answer or help from the tinder AI bot. When will someone actually listen to my request for assistance?"
lobo-loco812,"It's kinda devolved into another Tinder clone which sucks, still a slightly better experience but honestly I wouldn't recommend it to anyone"
Tareq Mehyar,"This is so much better than tinder, you get to select filters for language and all kinds of stuff, , girls do the first move, so no instagram models wanna be wo just wait for you to follow them on Instagram, this is legit and real deal"
CJ Chabot,No better than Tinder
Ayaz Mahmud,Better than tinder.
Kunal Parwani,I feel like Tinder is better
trevor hayes,"Terrible app, the free feature only allows you 10 swipes then you need to wait until the next day, you get notifications about matches and then when you go into the site nothing is there. Needs alot of improvement, just seams like a scam to me to force people to pay for subscriptions and then you can't cancell. Better of sticking with Tinder."
ghostface,Honestly not that great tbh a lot of the features cost a lot of money it's just sad. I used to enjoy using this app because it used to be about actually meeting someone and potentially dating them. But it's become just like tinder and plenty of fish just a cash grab app.
Jacques Fourie,M7ch better than tinder. Well done.
Daniel Lewis,"I can see a lot of negativity but it's a dating app at the end of they day, it's always gonna be hit and miss, but compared to Tinder which I've used a fair but, Bumble is a clear winner."
C AMA,"Worst app ever, together with Badoo and Tinder. They can all hold hands and jump into the deep."
Achin Datyal,Good app for dating The concept is good and better than tinder
Matthew Elmer,"banned for no reason. only reason I ever had it was because there's no alternative besides tinder, which is just as bad"
Christopher Stewart,Do not! Just don't. I downloaded this as well as tinder at the same time. Bumble 0 tinder 6.
Kevin Patel,Better than tinder
Fariborz Rahmani,The best. Even a lot better than tinder 😉
V Mahesh,Better than tinder.
Cody G,"Deleted for two reasons: 1) I don't like companies that give money to a group like Black Lives Matter and stuff like that. 2) I put in a ton of time on this app, and 90% or more of the profiles (I'm convinced by this) are either fake or that the women on this app aren't quality partners for long-term dating. Will never use this app again. This is Tinder with a different name and setup. Don't waste your time, y'all. Bumble sucks."
R.J. Cagampan,"Free features removed in favor of subscriptions. I used to be able to filter one or two tags, but now it's a premium feature. I work on the road, so these apps aren't a bad way to meet people, but I habitually have to watch distance as it seems to like queuing up people 75 miles away or in another state entirely. Somewhat confused userbase wants to use IG or Snap 90% of the time or forgets that women make the initial contact in the app. Tinder is just as bad, but has a better feature set."
Anthony Pierson,Way better than tinder
Marlita Nimmocks,This website does not allow freedom of speech. It is also extremely rampant in child sex trafficking. There are men on here who are looking for pictures of women with their children in them. Please beware of what pictures you put up. I believe that bumble is in on this as well as these other websites like Tinder and plenty of fish. They're all one group. Most definitely in on something sinister. I've seen too much crazy activity. These sites need to be shut down permanently.
Sam,Tinder seems to be much simpler and more accessible.
Kris King,"App is the new tinder. Makes you spend stupid money for anything tangible, spending money to even be shown, maybe get 5 swipes a day, any match you make is with either a bot or someone who wants to sell you onlyfans."
Christopher Mills,Bumble needs to hide any accounts that have been inactive for over two weeks. It's a waist of everyone's time and effort. I have been on it for over a year and nothing has resulted in a date. I have zero problems getting dates in person. ZERO. Dating apps are a tool and this one has become dull. Tinder yields better results for all types of relationships but fakes are about 80% Eharmony is empty. The league is 80% fake or inactive. Facebook dating is 95% fake. Never really tried Match. 36M
Kim Womack,"Used to be one of the best dating apps, until they started hiding everything behind the great great paywall, like Tinder does. Shame on you! - Thanks for your generic reply. Consider hiring skilled devs instead of marketing people.. For real."
Elle Bradley,"I was a big fan of Bumble until recently. I'm genderfluid & study the occult. I'd always limit the amounts of Christians/conservatives profiles I see because they have a tendency to hate crime me. Bumble took the feature to limit profiles away. It's now a premium feature. I shouldn't have to pay for a service that limits/decreases the transphobia I experience. I won't be on a dating app where I don't have options to make me safe. Bumble is becoming the new Tinder, and that's scary. Do better."
A Google user,"Interesting premise of women writing first. Doesn't work in reality (99% just write ""hey"" or send some random gif) but it's at least better than Tinder. UPDATE Jan2022: wow, tried app for first time in a couple years and they have really ruined it. So much moved behind paywall that the ""free"" use isn't even worth free. Clearly making all the same mistakes as Tinder. Moved to Hinge, no regrets."
Taran Vazquez,"Moderated to hell, can't edit your swipe preferences. But people on average put more into their profiles than on Tinder."
John Carey,Better than tinder
Kage,"Confirmed it does not work unless you pay. This is now a useless app :/ other apps are better unless you decide to pay. I have matched with many people on tinder who claimed to swipe yes on this app first. An when found on this app, We did not get the match. So we determined they are scamming"
Brian Griffin,Nobody matched with me. NOBODY 😂... well except this one girl that recognized me from tinder. I had this app about 2+ weeks now and nothing. I'm not ugly or anything and I don't want to blame the lack of matches because I'm black because every other app I get matched up even though most of them are predominantly white dating apps. And I'm down 30 dollars. Could've got door dash or something.
carl olivotto,Great app. Lots of free likes and a little more personal then tinder and 2 free search settings
Will A.,"They will take your money , robbing you blind, and nothing is guaranteed no matter the super swipe or spotlight. Dont belive in those. However, women respond more on here vs. tinder."
Saksham Meena,Better than Tinder
Rainbow Lover,This is just tinder but even worse 😕 subscriptions are forced matches are. Notifactions saying you have matches but then there being no matches. Magically gaining matches but none of them ever sending a messages. If youre a guy just don't bother downloading sorry.
Princess Bomongcag,Not that good as Tinder
GRaTePHuLDoL,"Major cash grab now, they used to actually give you a decent amount of likes, now it's like 10 every 24 hours, even less then Tinder"
Jay Reghe,"Too greedy, this lets you like lesser people than tinder does."
IndigoAurora,"I would have given the review more stars if it wasn't for the fact they removed the search feature for the free version of the app. The appeal of Bumble over Tinder is you can search what kind of relationship people want. They also have been gradually decreasing the amount of right swipes you get in a 24 hour period. I understand if you want people to pay for the full version of the app, but these kinds of practices will only make people use the app less and drive potential buyers away."
Jontae Hall,"This app is a waste of time. I thought about trying it since Tinder was no better in finding people to have a conversation, but at least over there I found some people. I have tried this app for a week with no luck. Plus making it so that the women initiate the conversation is stupid when there is a timer for them to respond to get a chat going, but half of them don't even want to talk first. Don't waste money or time here."
Chris _,"They need to do more to catch up to Tinder. Limit on likes is really low. And if there's a limit for females, that's quite surprising. I would prefer unlimited likes for females and a decent limit for males. Even if you pay, they will never have enough likes to see you ever. I would prefer Ads over limits."
Jan Huygelen,Way more engagement and matches than on tinder!
SPOONSOR SMATH,"I pretty much have nothing new to say about this app that already hasn't been said, Just stick with tinder."
Micarla Havenga,Great app better than tinder its like chanel version of dating apps nice people on here and I like that girls have to message first
Sashikant Dash,Worst app. They make it very difficult to cancel subscription and charge you repeatedly with no refund whatsover. Use tinder hinge etc which have much better interface and customer friendly policies
Efaz Kamal,The apps good and all like tinder but only down side is you have to wait for ur match to msg or respond first and before u know it they gone unless like tinder u msg first and within 24hrs if they don't respond it's bye bye for both of u
Yash Rao,"Worst Experience so far, I installed the app 3 weeks ago and after going through couple of profiles I realized its just another version of Tinder .We were doing a Short Documentary film on online dating and I wantedbto gather as much as information possible and for that I had to subscribe for premium membership and that was the wprst mistake. I canceled the membership within first week of subscription and now its been 3 weeks and am getting charged every week. Stay away its a scam."
Sir Lemon,"I don't know what other rating you expect when you lock the most important feature behind a paywall, being able to see who likes you. Is it so hard to just run ads in your app? Why are you insistent on being everything everyone hates about tinder. What a joke."
Fanamos Gaming,"This is the worst dating app for getting matches. ALL the other dating apps are much better at actually showing you the people who liked you. This app is trash. *Edit* Where do I mention paying to match? Seriously, this is the worst dating app, I don't recommend downloading it. Tinder, Hinge, Badoo and even Happen are all better dating apps than Bumble."
Travis,Compare to tinder way better.
Scott Baines,"Good app. Way better than Tinder. Suggestion for any bumble developers who may read this. Allow us to sort recent conversations we've responded to on top. Sometimes I get a flood of matches I'm not interested in, and I have to scroll down a lot to find the ones I want to talk to. Would be nice if I could send those to the bottom, while I continue talking to the ones I want to."
Baibhab Halder,This app also should be banned from India like tinder and Happn this app is of no use at all
Wilbur,"While it's better than Tinder, some of the features are terrible, like 5 SuperSwipes should be made available daily for lifetime subscribers instead of weekly. Secondly, your profile still doesn't get seen by others because the same profiles are shown again every few days even if you swiped right."
Karen Grafton,"Dating in general is hard, but I can't fault the platform for that. Out of the platforms I've used its the most user friendly, and its the only one I feel safe using. Their guidelines about harassment help a lot, and the resources for dating burnout and safety they have make me feel much safer than using tinder. I've also had a much easier time finding people who are at least easy to talk to even if we don't end up together. Usually I just feel like people want to get in my pants."
Luke Dornbush,"It was tough when you could pick one or two filters like ""nonsmoker"" or religious preference. You now have to subscribe to use any filter at all. If I want to wade through people with all my deal breakers, I can use Tinder for that"
Josh Diver,Knockoff version of tinder minus features
Ryan Deets,"It was perfect when it first came out after the updates and the changes recently it's less user-friendly and a lot more expensive it cost more than tinder. Update: I read your reply, you're literally arguing with my experience. You are right you have features that you don't have to pay for however if I want to continue to use basic features I have to pay for them and the rates you guys charge are more than tender. The updates you guys have processed since the app opened has become inconvenient."
Finly dude,"This app may be too smart. Jesus, same with tinder"
Eric Lopez,"What set bumble apart from tinder has now been removed and added to ""premium"". So if you chose to use bumble or tinder just know that both apps are now the same and you unlock the same feature by paying for a premium subscription."
D Ksiazek,Your account randomly locks out for no reason nor do you ever get feedback from bumble as to why. They will keep your money one way or the other. Complete scam. Better luck on tinder
arun jaykar,Not a lot of spam or bugs like tinder so overall great experience
A Google user,Women take the lead in selecting who they want to talk to. Guys have to like and don't need opening lines (profiles are short). I found this better than Okcupid and Tinder. Has video chat.
Mike Kingery,I'll be frank. This is one of the best dating apps out there. They even offer a lifetime membership for a hundred bucks. There are a lot of bad reviews about the app but I think a lot of that comes from the audience not knowing what they got. Bumble is miles ahead of tinder and other apps. They let you send live video clips Marco Polo style to establish a more personal connection and prevent catfishing. As well as pics. Bumble just gives you more. If you make use of it.
Mrigesh Parmar,"Completely useless dating app. You better off using Tinder and getting an actual person. Figured I would try it and got the 6 month sub. To my regret, a good majority of people I saw were people I had previously seen. Bumble states they don't have any bots which is definitely false. I should have stuck with BBB's rating of their company which is a big fat ""F"". This app just gets you to pay money for no actual results. ""IF"" and a big fat one at that, you managed to get an connection and make a relationship out of that you a lucky one."
Jonathan Lee,No race filter and other filters not free anymore. Time to uninstall. I mean is there a difference between this and tinder now ??
Noor Ashique,The worst app to invest in if you want to make friends/ date online. They will loot you with money and you will get no results. Women have to actually text you first to start a conversation 🤣 Like seriously. This is the dumbest decision on the planet especially when we all know that women rarely make the first move. Never ever waste your money here guys. This app is biased and will give you zero results. Tinder will always remain the king of online dating!
Murali Sai,The worest experience I have ever faced tinder is far better than this application
Obayanju Damilare,Better than tinder I guess
Familiar Stranger,"To Bumble's credit, I have matched and talked to a few women on there app using a free account. My main issue with Bumble is the people they are showing me. They all have identical personalities with different faces. A little too nerdy for me and I've been in different states. Tinder actualy shows me a variety of personalities. Thats why I delete the app. They are all dog moms, into bars & wine and they talk about their degrees. BORING!"
Robert L.,Had a few dates and girlfriends from this app. Left Tinder for it! The timed messages showed me who was genuinely interested and helped a lot!
T McD,Better than Tinder. Less fish pics.
Zen Smith,"Tested it for half year. Dont think this dating app works. Plus it puts up girls that live in other parts of Australia and says they live here in hobart, which means the matchn prossess is broken. i think i'll stick to tinder an pof. More bites there."
Beshoy Saad,"People who like you never show up in your feed, so that you are forced to pay to see them. I have been running out of swipes everyday and never have I seen any of my likes. Tinder is much better."
Luís Ângelo,"Better than tinder, for men at least"
Muneeb Ali,Better than Tinder
Shiro Zekken,Better than tinder !
Aaron E,"They finally did it. By removing the two free filters they've made this one of the worst dating apps on the market. It's now just tinder, but more expensive and with a worse user base. No point in using it now. In response to the creators, y'all ruined this app. It's a worse version of Tinder. Hinge did everything Bubble does, but 100x better. Just don't bother with this app. The only worse dating app I've used is PoF."
Félix Parent,App is fine I like the added features it has over tinder. I see a lot of people giving one stars here. I dont consider myself an attractive dude but I had tons of matches on here with actual girls and have had many meaningfull conversations. If you're not super ugly id give it a shot.
Gabriella Machado,I was banned after a few hours of making this account. I didnt even swipe on anyone! So how could I have broken any rules ? And i made sure i followed all directions and was willing to purchase packages to get noticed on the app but I was completely banned for no reason what so ever. I emailed them and have not heard back at all. This is the worst app ever especially for dating!!!! Tinder also sucks but this is the worst dating app I've ever tried.
Greyson Powell,"Feels a bit less scandalous than Tinder and matches seems to lead to relationships more often, but the most attractive girls are still on Tinder and $30.00 for just one month of premium is very steep."
Jeremy Shippelt,Months of wasted time with only 1 message. Many of the ladies here expect you to message them first (impossible by design). Many just want more Instagram followers. Many have pretty pictures with virtually no profile. Many are inactive. You would have better luck with PoF or Tinder. Or even IRL (ROFLMAO as if). :(
Kevin Y Leman Rusli,disgusting app. Still took $5 for no reason after I cancelled the subsctiption and my card. I am reversing all charges. Do a chargeback. Even tinder is somewhat ok
Laurence Martin,Tinder but worse.
Farah Jamil,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE BUMBLE ❤ A THOUSAND TIMES, NO ACTUALLY A MILLION TIMES BETTER THAN TINDER CAN EVER TRY TO BE!!! They truly care for their users, they aren't on a power horse deleting your account for No Reason! When you report someone and You let them know the reason, they send you a reply to tell you the action they took...So I'll never use another dating app but BUMBLE 🙏❣❣❣💯💯 I AM THE LUCKY ONE YOU GUYS, THANKS A MILLION FOR BEING MY FAVORITE GO TO SITE FOR DATING! I am currently taking a break to work on my self development, but once I am back BUMBLE IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE DATING SITE! BLESS YOUR HEARTS AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK =-)"
Brettxlol,"10 swipes a day for a guy is minimal. I must be super unattractive because I have only got 1 match being on this app and they unmatched before sending a message. This is just as bad as tinder. Edit, after being on the app even longer i received literally 1 more match that never replied. And none in the hive, dating apps have broken me im going to be a hermit in the woods."
Andrew Crane,"I never thought I'd see the equivalent of pay to win in a dating site. This app is virtually useless unless you pay their exorbitant prices for their subscription. And even when you do that you just quickly realize that the app is filled with narcissists, sexual abusers, and totally emotionally distant weirdos. If you consider yourself a decent person don't use bumble. It's honestly just the trash bin where people who get banned from tinder go."
Ricardo A. Z.,"It's an effective app for dating; nonetheless, I would say Tinder is one step ahead."
Nicholas Jones,"Love seeing all the negative reviews because they're all true!!!! Used to be great, but the like limit is so incredibly low now it's ridiculous. More and more features are becoming premium only. App is barely worth using anymore! When I first downloaded it had like a 4 star rating, now it's down to under 3 stars for good reason! That's what happens when you get money hungry! Hinge or Tinder is the way to go!"
Vinicius Hoyer,Melhor que o Tinder kk
Dave 888,Starts off ok and then you all of a sudden get the same matches over and over again. The app makes no attempt to block people who are here purely to advertise their Instagram profiles. Even when you block people they miraculously appear again. Its actually no better than Tinder.
Cameron Lanning,Needs to give pop-ups to the ladies after they match reminding them to send the first message. I keep losing all of my matches because they think it works like tinder
Bohuš Kováč,"Very few people, tinder knockoff, no original or new features which would actually help you to get to know someone. The only interesting thing is women having to make a first step. Pushes their subscription very aggressively, location has to be on at all times. Travel mode makes this completely unusable. You cannot pick country where you'd like your partners to come from. Basically just another useless run-of-the-mill dating app with ""buy! buy! buy!"" stupid marketing model."
David O,"Should be titled ""Paywall: the App"". I get you're encouraging people to be pickier with their likes but 3? Or however many it was? Rather go back to the hellscape of tinder at least I get to use the app for more than 2 minutes. Also the billing nightmare of others made sure I didn't spend a penny."
Chris Mainwaring,"All you fellas and girls who have had no luck on other apps get this one. It really works, I've been on Tinder, PoF, eHarmony and so many others for years and didn't get so much as a first date. I installed Bumble and within 3 days I got a match with a girl. We have now been together for almost 2 years and are now getting Married thanks to Bumble. Bumble, a dating app that works"
Vulture ANML,It cost more then health insurance at this point and it seems like their objectifying people as if their property rather then someone trying to meet an actual friend or lover. If your looking for real people or locals i advise you use tinder instead.
Revamped Rebel,Tinder but for simps. Simple as that lmao.
Lucas Willis,My initial review got removed. This app is still hot garbage. There are no free filters. When you pay for premium you still can't see people who liked you. Better off using tinder.
Ander Bilbao,"Everything behind a paywall now, just as bad as tinder..."
Habiba Akter,"This one of the best dating apps. Altough I am not kinda fan of any dating apps before. Bumble is much much more safer. Heart-felt thanks to it's creator who made it possible for woman to take the step first 👍. Importantly, till now i haven't experienced any harassment or vulgarity as faced it on Tinder. Only one day using Tinder I deleted my account because it's full of disgusting humanoid dogs! Highly recommend the Bumble one!"
Alipriyo Biswas,"Best dating app in India at the moment hands down. The women who match are actually genuine and they talk to you. I have tried numerous apps, but I've had way more interactions on bumble than on anything else. And I am free member still. The paid plans are all reasonably priced as well, compared to apps like Tinder."
1supersoniccontrol,Not as bad as tinder. But still i barely get to swipe on any people and half of these people are bots. Q
drum n bass dan,"Another app that started off well and as soon as it has everyone's attention, pow subscriptions and less swipes, alot of fake made up profiles along with there corparote apps Badoo, tinder etc all the same fake profiles, go take a look and see for yourself 😂😂 nope still the same fake people and the fact I wanted a day premium and you guys keep taking money without my consent, and no place to unsubscribe clearly just raking the money in, more so after reading other reviews"
Kyle Ashley,"I hate this app. Just as bad as Tinder, if not worse."
Komal Nadeem,"Used to love this app, but after they got rid of the 2 free filters there's basically no difference between this app and tinder."
Aditya Pyati,Did not let me swipe more than a day worst app it's better if you switch to tinder
Adanma Ojukwu,"I'd only use this for Bumble BFF if I redownload. For dating, they recently removed the option to add ANY filtering for free. About as effective as tinder, but at least mem can message you first there. The filtering was the only advantage Bumble really had, the novelty of the woman messaging first wore off."
Manil Manohar,I really like the candid guided profile builder.. So much better than tinder.
Synx Alliance,"Lowkey done with dating apps, like people talk for a short time then silence like tf more matches on here than tinder tho thats a plus I guess"
JEFFREY MARTIN,"Guys be nice if girls complain you will be kicked of this site forever. You get one opportunity in this life don't blow it. I like this site and the nice ladies more then OK cupid, Tinder and FB combined. Fb is the only one that comes close. This and Hinge are awesome. I like that I can send video clips on here. I like someone to hear and see me before they meet me."
Awesome Bong,Mera loura ka app h 2match hua h fir v msg nhi kar paa Raha. Socha tha Tinder se accha hoga . Lekin Tinder is the best. Benchodo msg larke log hi pehle karte hai
Steban Hern,Well done. It's tinder but with much more flexibility for networking and all that.
the spaceman,"Worst app in existence. No wonder feminist made it. You have to pay for everything, I hot few matches, but not a single girl was even worth pursuing. They are either feminist and think men want to date other men or they are overweight. Also 50% didn't even write after matching and other 50% that did, said ""Hey"". Guys just use tinder, this is app is for the ""woke""."
Daniele Lubrano,"Even worse than tinder, actually this is a scam, they charge you money and don't even give a refund"
Esteban Frisone,"Very good, two months already and I haven't got any messages from working girls,. Real people, 100% better than Tinder."
Stephan Butler,100% better than tinder I think somethings wrong with your algorithms. I decided to let my subscription to premium run out and all of a sudden there's way more people to swipe on and I'm getting more matches. Might be worth looking into... because if that's the case why would anyone buy premium?
Shauna Guglielmo,"Claims to be the safest dating app for women, but what safety features does it actually provide women? A man murdered a woman he net on here, men stalk women after dates. Bumble has done nothing about this! There is no after care to keep women safe. The only thing ""safe"" is that men can't just randomly message any female on this app. Bumble isn't any more safe than Tinder or OKCupid."
Kir-Sheng Chen,"Probably the worst user base. App used to be an wholesome alternative to Tinder but my experience with this app was full of clout chasers looking to promote their social media. The algorithm seems to push more people your way when you're making good progress with a match, and definitely when you're traveling. Look, this app's goal is to make money, not find you love. Look elsewhere if you're genuinely trying to create a healthy and fulfilling relationship."
Adi Mac,"Scam, take money when you didn't expect it..I get 3 or 4 matches a day till you pay and then they stop arriving. No response from the Devs and if you do it's to tell you that need to check their rules. Just check this review page. No response. They only want your money. If you're paying for a service. Go to match. Com, tinder where the app is popular amd real."
Nicholas Laipply,Not a bad app. Definitely better than Tinder. Running into a lot of Christian women though....
Arctic W. Fox,Wow... an app that’s worse than Tinder?
William Dyce,"Nice design and generally user friendly and comfortable, with few bots. Good if people in your area use it. The trouble with all these Tinder-like apps though is you never know what you're actually paying for. Say you pay for a boost: was your profile actually being shown to anyone before you boosted? Was it shown to anyone after? How many more? There's no way of knowing. The algorithm that determines whose profile gets shown to whom is a black box you can throw money into like a wishing well."
Alex Marshall,"Solid, doesnt shove the payed features in your face like tinder does. Only thing id change is the ""women text first"" feature because a solid chunk of them are NOT used to texting first on dating apps which has already lost me some solid matches. If that got changed id make it a 5 star."
Marcus Hughes,"You can tell they got their 'logic' from Tinder. Waste your time if you feel like it, but there's mostly only people who do not know what they want, or Bumble created bots to match with you so you'll be deceived and think they're actually people."
Unica,More matches than tinder and at least girls have to make initiative
Dividends_with_Alisher,"It's ok, not too happy with this remind me of tinder"
Dev A,"Awful. I remember being on tinder and going on multiple dates/meeting tons of new people. Even found my ex on that app, but I can barely seem to get any matches on here and I pay for premium. This is a scam and the few I have spoken to on here are absolute dogshit people with ulterior motives. Download if you're looking to get emotionally damaged!"
Chris Blatner,"Formerly a five-star review, this app has gone way downhill. It went from having all the features Tinder had for free, to some for free, and now you get less features and it costs way more money than Tinder. I get that inflation is a thing, but all these features are something you just lift with a paywall, More people would sign up at a reasonable price. Hinge and tinder are both cheaper and both have niches, bumble is now just the expensive app where women message first, go elsewhere go elsewhe"
Benino Juarez,"Bumble was once better than Tinder. Now it's just like junk apps in your phone. I will no longer use Bumble. The developers had something good in their hands, but like most Good Apps, they all come to an end over GREED. My money will now go somewhere else."
Amin Moghadam,Much healthier environment than tinder
Fruits Valley,Better then Tinder .......
Tobijah Abrahamsen,"I wish I could give it a negative star like it was a good app back in 2019 I had a few good dates to but now it's just like Tinder, POF and all the other dating apps. you gotta pay for every little thing to "" better your chances"". And if you do match that it no conversion no dates just a huuuuuge drag. You would have a better chance on Instagram then this app."
Justice Alistair,"Other than the numerous dummy accounts (Ex. ""Message me on IG, notifications are OFF"") similar to the ones you find on Tinder, it's really weird with the swiping. I swipe once, I've hit my quota. I wait 24 hours to swipe again, I've hit my quota. Technically, it's forcing you to pay."
J. S.,I ignored the reviews. Don't be like me. This app is useless and just a moneygrab. Better off with Tinder
Elvis Chibundu,"What thing I hate about this app is I don't match with people close to me, Tinder is better in this aspect, one reason I love this app is there are many reasonable people in there Tinder is full of dushbags"
Frankie R,"I do like this dating app better than tinder, and a lot better than hinge. I would be willing to use the premium services but it's way too expensive! I'd be willing to pay £10 a month at a max, not £32!!"
Sharbel Kj,"The app use fake likes to make you pay for subscription. The idea of a woman texting first is nice, but that's will never happen. The application interface is very nice. It's better than Tinder. If there's a week free trial, that would be nice to see the app potentials ."
Armen Petr,This up is worse than tinder.
Tee Wright,Just another tinder. Took away height feature.
Harshad Patil,Worth giving it a shot! Better then OKC and Tinder hands down!
jani sab,This app better then tinder .
Brian Cheong,"Used to be great. They allowed you 2 free filters to determine what you're looking for. Now that they've taken that away, it might as well be tinder."
Darius,Just use hinge or tinder. They're so hungry for money these days this app feels like a scam. You get about 15 right swipes then you have to wait 24hrs for another 15. The chances that you match with someone with those swipes and actually end up meeting up seems improbable statistically.
Luke Davies,"Pointless, it's specifically made so women can message first but just like tinder, 99% of the time, they won't. There should be penalties or something for women who match and don't bother messaging."
Damian Bosson,"Average, tinder is better"
The Dark Lord,"Tinder is better. Don't waste your time with bumble. Unless you pay them money, you get like 10 swipes a day."
Doug,"Really gone downhill in order to monetize users. Barely allowed any swipes and even then there's no way to filter without paying. Started using the app less and less over the years. Probably gonna just delete soon. Hinge, Facebook dating, and hell even Tinder are better at this point."
L1ME SPE3DST3R,"Terrible app to get matches , it is designed to get you to pay for the IDEA that you are matching with someone, I remember when this app started and to be honest this app is not worth it , you are better off using tinder or hinge. The edit below me is not going to address the problem"
Ismael Martner,"Got greedy and followed tinder footsteps, trying to mask it as making us me conscientious in who we like. Wouldn't recommend nowadays"
Dave Morgan,"This app sometimes takes more than a day to refresh, allows a couple of likes and then decides that's all you're getting again for a random amount of time. Women message first. Unfortunately nobody seems to have told them. Popular profiles are moved to the front of the queue too, so unless you are one of these perfect insta-models, you aren't going to be matching with anyone any time soon without paying over £30 a month. Shame, this app used to be better than Tinder."
Jonas Iniguez,"for a dating app not too bad, alhorith decent compared to tinder"
Christen Lauren,"Bumble was my dating app of choice until they took away all the features that made it worth using. You used to be able to use up to 2 filters i.e. intent (something casual, relationship, marriage, etc). Now I can't filter out the same creeps that are on tinder and pof unless I pay for these features, which quite frankly as a female, am not willing to do. Bumble has become another disappointing hookup app. DELETED, UNINSTALLED. FOR GOOD! 👎👎"
Tim Braithwaite,Great alternative to tinder
Raul Castillo,So here's my thing. I know im not an absolute Adonis of a dude but I feel like I'm not gonna be put out there at all without buying the premium version of the app. I've had for a couple months and no matches. That all being said I do prefer the format of this app more than I do tinder. Like I said I'm willing to accept that maybe it's just me and that's fine. I'm just saying that I have a hunch that it's not.
Archon peps,Sexist tinder. No thanks.
Nathan Allwood,Plenty of attractive women. You barely get any daily likes. Women never message first so no messaging occurs. I have alot more success on tinder.
Tanner MacDonald,"So you guys are really stupid eh. I just bought a month subscription to the premium service. Within 5 minutes I remake my account fully expecting my purchase to Transfer over to my NEW bumble profile (I've done it many many times on Tinder and the purchase/subscription renews upon reaching maximum number of swipes) NOT ON BUMBLE they just stole 40 dollars from me, and now when I go to look at the prices for the service?? THERE ARE NOW CHEAPER OPTIONS AVAILABLE?!?! Support has been contacted"
Kevin Owona,"Constantly offline for some reason and takes ages to connect unless I'musing Wi-Fi. I used to pay for subscription, when i stopped it I could only swipe like once a week for like 2 minutes. Less fake profiles than tinder but come still a handful"
Corey Hunter,You have to upgrade to premium to see who matched with you. More microtransaction BS. Badoo and tinder are better.
Amit Pandey,"Dear friends currently I am using premium, i dont get any matches not a single one after premium.. I have good face, pix, bio, still I don't get matches.. This is too worst app.. They don't help in setting your account problem's.. They only reply your account is ok you can swipe... I paid 699 rs. It got wasted.. Tinder is best they charge 385-390 approx and gives best services.. There are enough users.. U can easily match to them.. Here chances of likes, matches are zero. Please don't try it😌"
Peabo Parker,"Wack. The premise is nice, but when you give women the option to message first and all you get is a ""hey"", might as well stay on tinder"
Matt Holm,"Bumble has removed free filters, cut down on options for users, and increased their prices. The product has become progressively worse over the years, slowly moving in the directio of another Tinder-like, just like eveything else."
Douglas McTeer,"Only thing this app has going for it is the lifetime premium content. Which for some reason I doubt will remain life time. Other than this... either women are shy as hell or this app doesn't even put you in stacks. I'm not a 10 but I'm sure as hell not a 1. 1 match after being on the app for 3 months in a very populated area. Sus to say the least, plus... I mean am I surprised, this is an off shoot from a tinder employee so... 🤷‍♂️ Not really..."
Kyle Hersh,Sucks as bad as tinder
Ryan the Lion,"Yoooo! What have you done?! You've removed the two free filters! I'm going to have to wade through dozens of profiles that say ""Want someday"" on kids and cannot select a preference for height. What the devil are you playing at, Bumble? The only difference between you and Tinder is the time limit for a match to send a message... I'm not so fussed about the right-swipe limit since I only swipe right on about 5% of profiles. Get it together, Bumble! You used to be the numero uno app!"
Zombie DJ,"Offers cheap daily premium which is worth it when you have a bunch of likes and wanna go through them, and the app actively places people who liked you in your swipes unlike tinder, would give 5 stars if there was no premium but I get they have to make money somehow"
Neuro Doctor,"Gender biased app full of cheating wives, girlfriends and hookers. Way worse then tinder not even close"
derek jobe,"Basically I pay $30 a month for this app just so I can match with 2 people a month, who then want me to partake in some three way, with their current parter. Had I known that these were the users on this app, I would've stuck to Tinder."
Michael Di Candilo,Bumble was better when it came out.. It's similar to Tinder where you barely get any matches & even if you do the woman seldom reply.. plus the number of people before you run out of swipes is pathetic.. improve your app.
Cole Talbot,"This is basically worse Tinder, one chicks bio was ""I was banned from tinder so now I'm here"" Apparently it's worse than it was and I've been on this app for 2 months and only have the same person liking me so you should totally fix your app cause it kinda sucks everything is behind a paywall and I don't want to see men instead of women in my feed. If no one got banned from tinder, however that happened this app would be useless"
Emiscary1,"Imagine Tinder, but worse."
Gabriel Naressi,my photo keeps getting deleted (it is a normal picture I use in tinder) this is why you'll never be #1
kelokill streamer,"Use to generally be the best app now it's worse then tinder! You get about 10 swips if your lucky, and the premium is 100% not worth it and over priced. You had an excellent app model which you ruined by being greedy worse so than tinder."
Angad Lobo,The app algorithm is so so bad that for the date it will not give you even one like... Even if you use spotlight... It is better to use tinder where you get likes and ya they are just robbing money don't download the app
mark murimi,Bye! Bye! I guess tinder is not bad after all. Done with this bubble thingy
Sebastian Larisma,Its frustrating that before i could at least swipe a hundred. But now rlly? Been consistently having 10 swipes a day. Man that's how u guys badly want someone to sub? Thought u were better than tinder but y'all the same.
Jared Thomas,"Had for years, worse than Tinder."
Cameron Spicer,It's tinder but more boring if your not a 9 or 10 don't bother especially if your a guy men are meat now it's so sad.
Jake Johnson,"Gentlemen do not waste your time with this app because that's what you'll be doing. Women make the first move on here, which doesn't sound bad except 9 times out of 10 they will not message you first. Which is fine except they have 24 hours to message you or else the app will automatically unmatch you. Then they want you to upgrade your account to use features that use to be free. Why am I gonna pay money for an app where women will not message me? Just use tinder. You'll have a much better expe"
Brian C.,"Horrible app, removed all free features. Going back to Tinder."
Aashirwad Kashyap,Better than Tinder
NITIN TAKSANDE,Best dating app. Even better than Tinder.
Bruno Trozzi Rufino,Mejor que Tinder y Happn juntos! 👍
Brenna,"This app has always allowed for 2 advanced filters to be used by everyone, which was recently taken away. The freebie advanced filters were the only reason I preferred this app over tinder or all other apps I've used and used to recommend to friends for this reason. No longer will be recommending or using with this change."
Kat L,"They used to allow you to search for 2 advanced filters and now you have to pay for any. No longer any different from Tinder, except the restricted 24 hr time window, which doesn't work for people who have busy lives."
darthrysen,"Sorry to see this app has gotten greedier and greedier, features that were free have slowly become paid. Bumble used to be a great alternative to those sick of pof and tinder, now it's just the same."
Iulian !,"As a male, I had a few matches when I first installed the app, but nothing until then. It seems that they walk on the path of Tinder: you either pay, or you go to the back ranks. LE: I tried the premium option for a week, no match even with boost. After the premium option ended, bang: two matches. The matching algorithm on this app is a bit off."
Sudhanshu Agarwal,Got no matches. And i know I'm not being swiped at all (not just left) because i have a TON of matches on Tinder. So the algorithm Bumble uses is trash.
frederick baker,"Great concept and features that keep getting stuck behind pay walls. You use to be able to backtrack 3 times a day and use 2 filters, and then pay to use more of either. But now you have to pay for those features, which makes it only slightly different than Hinge or Tinder, which seem to have more people any way. Not sure if it's worth keeping this app anymore."
george andrasik,Yes happy with bumble pricing is fair not like tinder good quality pictures yes I'll be using bumble
Christopher Richard,Horrible App. This app charges you 3-5 seperate times just to use basic functions. This is the worst dating app I have ever used!! EVER! I have 4 matches but cant even see them until I pay an extra 35$. Then I have to pay extra for each Button I want to press such as the back button. Then it wants me to pay for a membership as well on top of all of that. On top of all this as if it were not enough already it only shows you 1/5 of Matches. Horrible App!!!!! TINDER BLOWS THIS APP OUT OF THE WATER!
Hixbi Fox,"Scam, because of the algorithms you get buried at the very bottom of the pile. When you start swiping you see these beautiful girls that aren't even on the app, (swipe the first three off to the left you'll never meet them/dead accounts.) No, buying a subscription will not help you. Do not waste your money, the algorithm is what kills you. I've had the same curated profile on three different dating sites, I haven't met a single person on bumble. All my good relationships came from tinder."
Joe Reeves,"They made it so the filter feature is only for premium accounts now. There is no longer any reason for me to use this over tinder, which also has way more users than bumble."
Sean Turton,"Why the hell has it changed??? 😒😒 You get to swipe on 5 women and then you run out, sound bumble no problems ✌️. Do you want to make it any harder than it already is to date someone. Come on sort yourselves out. I didn't think the these words would come out my mouth, but it's actually worse than tinder."
Chris Fouch,This app used to be better than tinder. Now it's like a pay to win app. You don't get very many free right swipes and you have to pay an unreasonable amount just to have a chance of meeting someone
James choi,Somewhat it is better than tinder even I have platinum in tinder it is not working enough.
Michael,"New review after a year of use: I like how it is and see why women should message first, But chances is with your matches they won't say anything. I matched with 3 ppl 1 who I knew from high school, but they said nothing. So far this app just been a big tease imo. Nothing good came from it yet. Never had a covo with anyone, Maybe it takes patience idk..but using this app after tinder makes me not want to try dating again just stay single."
Trey Cook,"My technical issues from a previous review have been solved. Unfortunately the app is falling off. The number of swipes you're allowed is extremely limited, more basic features are becoming paywalled, and the prices keep increasing. It's just as bad as Tinder now."
Giki,This app used to be one of the best that I checked in often. But now they lost me becos I violated one of their policy for being streamline upfront with my selection of date. It was for my protection not up against anyone. But it seems to be taken the wrong way. So I'm happy bumble's rating has went down on par with tinder so quick and swift taking a comparison of their users download rating.
Jonas Sweep,Much more actually interesting people than on Tinder. Also much more nuanced and easy to weed out what qualities you do or do not like/want in a possible match.
James Cooper,Like most of the other comments...starts you off miles away. Shady asf. Imagine Tinder still being better. Uninstall the p.o.s.
Gage Warner,"Bumble used to be better than Tinder, but became just as money hungry"
A Google user,"Profiles don't load. App is literally unusable. Paid for premium for to get a free boost but the boost cost extra. Removed filter option. Tinder is better, and tinder is absolute trash. Bumble isn't worth the storage on your phone"
jason suttle,"Always makes me close the app and reopen to see new notifications, needs to update weekly or it will not work, there are much better dating apps out there. Lots of Biggins in here too. Adding more 11/13 with full service and 5g it takes literally minutes to open a page, or profile. This happens in all areas. None of the other dating apps lag like this. I can't wait 3 minutes to respond to someone of all the app is downloading. Back to tinder... 12/24/21 updated.. App still sucks, good for faties"
Aaron Melczarek,"Feature erosion, disappearing behind microtransaction paywalls make this just as bad as tinder. Having likes not show unless you pay basically are basically holding your likes and the functionality of this app hostage unless you pay. It makes me wonder if some of the likes are real as they never show when swiping regardless of filters ('advanced' filters now a paid feature) and even if you exhaust the people in your area."
Leigh Anne Lloveras,I no longer see a point in having this app since they removed the free filters. It is basically Tinder now.
PAWANJOT KAUR BAWEJA,"great concept, better than Tinder for sure"
Eryuna me James,"Good app,but it charged me before my renewal date,i still have 22 hrs and my card was already charged.Thi is outrageous, not even tinder charges before due date I will be deleting this app if theres not a solution."
Karim Attia,Better UX than Tinder. I hope it will gain adoption. Edit 12.21.: Subscription reactivated without me doing anything and just charged me. Thus 1*.
spawn sniff,Great app much better than tinder. I like the photo sending option and the random question ideas they offer to get conversation going. 10/10
Louise G,"The same concept as Tinder although targeting women as being a 'relationship site'. A safer and nice place to find dates without the creeps and sex pests. I had a few matches who I messaged first, the truth is hardly any reply. The one guy who replied was looking for casual *sigh* Like Tinder it matches by age and distance, but you find they are 'passing through' and aren't as close as you'd first hoped. Decided to delete it after a week. Guys don't reply to messages."
Ben Axelrod,"With this new update removing the 2 free filters, this app has become as useless as tinder, will be uninstalling it soon"
Lyenta,I used to like this app because of the free filter setting. Now they changed that.. and you have to pay for all filters. I hate it.. makes it no diff from tinder... why use bumble then...
Garrett Humbert,Not much to say. Not great ui or user experience. Over charges on absolutely everything and I barely get any matches compared to tinder. I'll probably get 10 to 20 matches a month on tinder and 1 on here.
Patrick Carroll,"Don't bother, same lot as tinder, payeall central."
Luca Gentile,this app has great potentials. It's similar to tinder. I love the sorting by distance & audio messaging features. It only needs more people on board. One feature that could be developed it's to show first the online people. I have met a couple of people from here and they were nice. I guess that on Bumble they look for more serious stuff than on other platforms.
karthick Kumar,Really doing good than Tinder
Deyquan Reid,A pitiful reskin of tinder.
Alex Caister,Used to be really good dating app I have been on and off for few years. I had no issues with matching people and I have had some good dates unfortunately they didn't work out. With the recent updates I seem to be limited to 5 swipes right then I'm out of likes compared Tinder this very short and the removal 2 free filters for free users is also rubbish. Used to prefer Bumble to Tinder however with recent limitations it worse than free version of Tinder.
Kyle Nicholls,Better than Tinder for sure
Tim Spencer,"A lot of features that used to be free, you now have to pay for. Seems to be far less active users than tinder. Certainly not worth paying for. A 2.6 score in the app store is terrible, pee-yew bumble, your app stinks!"
Jan Menklooten,Good dating app as a premium user. It's not used as much as Tinder in my region. I hope the marketing team will target my region soon.
Richards Babu,Its definitely better than tinder in every aspect. Profiles are genuine. Its not like zero response. I did manage to make few friends
Jeff Leone,What the hell bumble? You turned into tinder in the worst ways. Daily swipe limits. Have to pay for advanced filters. Your likes don't show up even if you extend your search area. No unswipes unless you pay. You were so good in the beginning but now you suck like tinder. You will never get a dime out of me.
Aaron McCollum,"Removed free advanced filter, now this is just tinder"
C F,"This app gets worse and worse. Now perfectly acceptable pictures are ""moderated"". Sad to say Tinder is better now."
Asli Ozcan,Better than tinder lol
James Griffith,Worst dating app I've used so far. It costs double than tinder and I have never gotten a match in the last literal year of using it.
Andre Jackson,Got rid of the option for one free filter the only reason I preferred this app over tinder was my ability to filter out all the bad matches now my feed is full of them. To have the option of filters again I would need to pay $30 a month absolutely ridiculous since this was a feature for free before . Deleted my account won't come back.
Ajinkya Munge,"Removed the very reason this app is more bearable than Tinder, especially for men. They removed the 2 free filters. It's almost pay to win on this app now. Uninstalling. Flooded with unwanted people, unusable."
Weird Name,New update crops pictures horribly and now that you cant filter out what you dont want for free theres nothing that makes this app better than tinder. It used to be good.
David Sforza,"This was my preferred dating app, but now that they have removed free advanced filters, it's no different from Tinder. I'll stick with Hinge."
Ty,"What first started as a decent alternative to tinder has quickly become a greedy and restrictive app. When you sign up, you are forced to verify yourself or get deleted. Contacting support is useless because they're just going to say to verify or get deleted. As well, when you actually start using the app, you can only swipe right on as little as three people before you've hit ""today's limit"" and must wait 24 hours to continue."
Dalton Mills,"They removed the ability for free users to have ANY advanced filters. You get age, gender, and distance now. Which isn't much different than tinder in my opinion."
Rahul Pareya,"Honest review. For boys- It's a waste of time and money. They just show you random profiles. Do not fall into the idea of premium account,or any kind of upgrading. I had a premium account. Nothing works. Either girls are too introvert to even prompt first or the company has fake profiles of girls. Not even tinder works"
Stephen Lazer,Taking away the filters takes away what made bumble great. Do we really need another tinder?
Zalz Torus,"They removed any kind of match sorting on free, making it useless. Wants to be Tinder but that already exists."
toaster in the tub,"disgustingly money hungry. first they take away the ability to reverse a swipe for free. then they tale away the ability to set 2 free preferences. Im pretty sure they even decreased the amount of swipes before you ""hit the daily limit"". Do you idots actyally exoect that to bring more money. No wonder people take tinder more seriously"
Brian Polk,"charging for features that were free and more swipes is criminal, but it has a much better ui than tinder. I like that women have to message first, as a male, it is nice to see."
Brian Jongseong Park,"With the recent series of updates, it's basically becoming Tinder. Advanced filters are no longer available for free users, which is the final straw for me."
Joseph Karle,I used to be able to have 2 advanced filters for free. Very disappointed that they took that away. Feels like bumble is regressing. Probably gonna end up deleting my account after this. It's turning into tinder.
Matthew Gardner,"Used to be pretty good. But the need to satisfy shareholders, they made short-sighted decisions to limit the functionality. It's just tinder with a better interface but smaller user base now."
M C,"6th time posting this review because bumble or Google keep deleting it. Everything is now behind a pay wall except the first 5-10 swipes a day. No more filters, playbacks or beelines. Effectively everything that made it better than tinder is gone since the February bumble IPO. They are Nickle and diming everything and it's no longer worth the effort."
Alison Mills,"Bumble was my preferred dating site because I could at least use a couple of filters without having to pay the exorbitant subscription prices but now it looks like it's all about the money- no ability to filter anything except age and distance!! complete waste of time now, may as well use Tinder"
Brian Brick,"App went from early five stars to barely more than 1 very quickly. Most recent updates put ALL filters behind a paywall. It went from my preferred app to no better than tinder. Goodbye bumble, you were nice for a little while."
Hunter Nichols,Cheap Tinder clone with more in depth profiles but no way to filter them out. Three swipes and I'm at the end of the line. It's time to go out and risk catching covid to find love.
SumSkittles,Removed 2 free advanced filters. This app was already not great. Now it has nothing to standout on. Might as well get Tinder now.
M G,"They took away the only feature I used Bumble for -- the free ability to filter for just 1 or 2 important things (drug use, wanting kids, or what someone is looking for). As I woman, why would I use an app where I'm forced to message first where I can't filter at all? It's no better than Tinder."
Brandon W,"Amongst the best I've seen. No need to pay for anything unless you want to upgrade to a premium experience like tinder which gives major benefits. Otherwise, it's easy, popular, and lacks boys from my personal experience"
David Yarmark,They removed the two free advanced filters which was one of the main benefits of this app. Now it's basically just Tinder. I would not waste my time with this app.
Amin S,"This app has become into Tinder. What a mess, bring back the height filter."
Mercedes Leashore,Nobody wants to date this app is turning into tinder
Victoria Larson,Bumble has become a cash grab app. Cant even add one filter without paying now which essentially just makes it tinder. I expect to see bumble become like other dating apps that don't even let you message users without upgrading to a paid subscription. Likely will move back to tinder now since the demographic is essentially the same and tinder requires less work for me as a female.
Andrea Poole,"I used to love bumble because I was able to filter out people I didn't want to see. I was able to apply 2 filters without paying for a subscription. However, I recently began noticing people that should have been filtered out were not. I went to update my filters, and I'm no longer able to apply any filters without paying. That was the entire reason I preferred Bumble over Tinder, and they just removed it. Very unhappy with that decision."
Nelly VanD,The new version where you can't filter height without paying just took the one good thing bumble had over tinder! So annoying!
Tim Sina,"Don't use this app, was good until they sold out and became greedy. You have to pay to get suitable matches and the pricing is incredibly high. Better off with tinder or hinge"
Amy Anderson,"So I used to love bumble simply because it was all in the woman's hands. It also allowed for you to adjust preferences without having to pay. Now you don't have a choice if you want any kind of adjustments you have to pay, which is ridiculous. They give no other options... you literally have to pay for everything now in this app... 😒 If I wanted to swipe for free. I would just use tinder"
Christophe Trepanier,just stick to tinder
Fanny K,It constantly says I am offline although I am connected to WiFi or data. And why on earth would you remove the 2 free filter? I used to like this app but they are really trying to get on tinder's level.
War Ren,Can no longer set any filters without paying. Becoming just like tinder.
John Travolta,"Bumble has been problematic enough as it is, but this is the last straw. Putting all filters behind a (overpriced) paywall is unacceptable, and I removed all accounts within the same day. Bumble may as well be Tinder now, but hypocritical. The only good thing to come from this update is people will remember that dating only works in the real world."
Andrew Barlass,"This app no longer allows me to only see people of my specific religion. It's hard enough having to use the ""other"" religion category, and now I can't even filter by that. I had just paid for some super swipes too :( Didn't want to pay $30 per month though for other features I don't care about. I'm going back to other apps which let me filter by religion. What a shame, as this app used to be pretty good, compared to other ones like tinder. Now it's just another useless tinder knock-off."
Zaina 93,On the last update of the app: it's horrible! now you have to spend money in order to filter if you want to see people who are looking for relationships or marriage to show up or another filter. It used to be 2 free filters and if you want more you pay. Now you gotta pay even for these 2 filters. It turned to more of tinder culture. This app was doing good until recently. It went down hill
y gh,"I liked that you could set preferences, that was the one big up over tinder. Well, that's over because now you have to pay for that. I'm deleting the app"
Connor Collins,"It was nice while it had the advanced filters because it set it apart from tinder, you now have to pay for even one let alone have 2 free filters. Women engaging first on the conversation is pointless because it's always a starter I would get ignored for. Was fun while it lasted, uninstalling."
Bre Rogers,"Glitchy. I relatedly have to uninstall and reinstall because half the time it won't log me in and freezes on the home screen. App acts like a beta version of tinder, needs a some serious tweaking."
LadyRayray14,"I use the bff mode and I like it better than tinder. The only thing I wish it had for example: if I see a profile and I am not sure I like them or not, there should be a skip button so I can come back to the profile later but continue to look at other profiles. Or even an option where you can go back through all the people you disliked and see if maybe you do like something about them after all then you can swipe right on them"
nabil razin,Someone's reported my account for fun & my profile got banned. Not one but both accounts. I subscribed to premium. I used to think this is the the best social app. But now it's just a rubbish. They just try to make more money. You guys are not even better than tinder! FRAUD
Dajour Livingston25,Like everyone else is saying. They want you to pay for more swipes etc etc. It's just like Tinder waste of time and money. DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!
Jeremy Rose,"Eh, I suppose it seems to be better than tinder. I'm unsure if it really is any better though personally, but the profiles appear to have more effort put into them."
Gibran Ex_RAF,"Terrible, like so many so called dating apps... So much money is asked for and so little in return... The 24hr thing is a joke. It says you have matches and no one messages you... it's down to the girls to messge you... At least on tinder I can message and if I don't get a response in a week I just remove the match..."
George Vlaykov,Somehow better than Tinder...
Kendra Cameron,"I just all around hate this app. I paid for a lifetime membership for some dumb reason. I hardly ever come across anyone that I'd even be interested in. (I have tinder too and seem to do okay there.) I'm not sure what it is about bumble,but I've had no success. When I do occasionally come across a match, they either don't message back or don't try with the conversation. Men, just in general, seem lazy af on bumble. Maybe because the woman has to initiate."
Nicholas Winkowski,Way better than tinder that's for sure. Profiles look and feel and are real. More metrics to check someone out which is awesome.
Southpaw74,Better than Tinder
Brandon Hooper,"This app is awful. It will not let me upload any photo, even though they are 100% compliant with their guidelines. When I expressed this to customer support on multiple occasions, the continued useless response I get is a list of their guidelines. Again, I am 100% compliant with them so knock off the BS and listen to your complaints. Use Tinder, FB Dating or POF instead. The verification actually works and the customer support is not grotesquely incompetent."
Bradley Lombardo,I was banned for no reason.. use pof or tinder.. im not sure what i did..
CompileNix,"It's a nice idea and an alternative to tinder. I got several matches and guess what, not a single woman actually wrote a thing. It's the perfect ""let's match and then never write""-Simulator."
Mohammed,"EIGHT matches on Tinder, ZERO match on Bumble, so either Bumble people are too picky, or the algorithm is weak af (Hint: it's the latter)."
Alex Conway,Basically just a sexist Tinder so if you're into that then cool.
Saleh Hashmi,"God you guys have become even worse than Tinder. What the hell, your going to retain my data even after account has been deleted? Atleast tinder deletes it right away. This point really shows the womensk leadership in the company. Only a women would to keep posted on its exs. I already talked to the team. And they want me to send more info just to delete it. So what now you can get bank accounts under my name too? I am being sarcastic but come on. Who the asks for gov. id. card for a dating app?"
jacob jones,"It works. At least for me I've never had any bugs or issues with the app and Ive met a fair amount of women off Bumble. The problem I think is that Bumble is very pricey compared to Tinder, it's very unappealing to pay bumble $29.99 a month versus tinder $64.99 for a year. Bumbles lifetime subscription also seems very overpriced for $149.99. Bumble claims to be a more premium experience for women where they have the control, but that's at the cost to the men. Solid app, to pricey though."
Anass ElMimouni,Does not really work. Either all women there are a spam or it is like a place where people put their info and forget about it. All of the matches i get no one talks and I got no matches in comparison to tinder where i got a lot every day
GreenyBro420,"I rate bumble -10,000 because this app is nothing but a joke I'm going back to tinder"
Secret One,Constantly the apps takes forever to show people and when it does it only shows a few...I have changed my settings and it does the same... This all happened after I went premium 🤔🤔🤔 before then I wasn't having this problem.. Needless to say I will not renew. Tinder performs better.
Something_Else,Just like Tinder this apps algorithms are designed for extortion and social influencing/manipulation.
Kevin M,"Scam !! Save ur privacy and bypass this app!! I would give it a 0 rating if had the chance ....10 million downloads and still on beta version! they are just in the gathering and selling data business....it simply just doesnt work...stays offline..all i get is a yellow screen saying ""bumble""..and needs my location all the time, not just when on the app!!! 🤷🏽‍♂️.... tinder is a way better compared to this and thats saying a lot🤣"
Omi Jay,"Been more than 48hrs 11 matches lol I can see them matched on the top, some are expired some are about to expire some will expire soon lol. Not a single person is messaging lol. Actually bumble doesn't let the other person know that it is a match lol. You think that the other person is not messaging you first, but the other person doesn't know at all hahahaa, i matched with someone on tinder same person from bumble, they said they didn't know at all, dear Bumble developer was kicked from tinder"
Justin Anderson,Bumble used to be better. In it's humble beginnings it was an honest dating app which helped people out of their comfort zones and make some real success stories. I think it took a turn for the worse when it became popular and undistinguishable from Tinder. I hardly get any likes compared to other dating apps so there's no motivation or incentive to be an active user. I feel like online dating has started to take a backseat to going out and meeting honest people in real life. No bots though!
Anirudh Parengal,"Not enough profiles, algorithm is proper wierd, because you wouldn't even get 1 like (not matches) with premium, while used to get around 100-120 matches (not likes) per month on tinder platinum. I asked for my money back, but customer service showed me the no refund policy as expected!"
Devanshu Maheshwari,Much Better than tinder!!
Alec Maynard,"""hey"" Bumble, the app that gives women the power to say nothing and then wait for you to open. The same cycle of monitising misery as every other app, unless you're smart enough to follow online dating rules 1 & 2. Basically tinder but worse."
Katie Finkbeiner,Tinder and this app are terrible
Rifki Syahputra,Way better than tinder and other dating app. Nice concept and execution.
Seben Griffin IV,"This is one of, if not the DUMBEST dating apps I've been on. The fact that the app is designed to where girls have to make the first move is stupid in and of itself. Women hate making the first move! Anybody who knows anything about women would know that. I've paid for I don't know how many of those spotlights, and it did nothing. The premium version doesn't give you any better results than the free version. You're just dishing out money for no reason. Bumble is trash. Try your luck with Tinder"
ken zortman,I have never seen anything like this app. Do yourself a favor and redo your tinder profile and POF profile because you'll talk to way more woman there than at bumble. I have installed all 3 at the same time and have had many real conversations with woman on the other two than I have on bumble. All 3 want money but at least the other two seem less fixated on obtaining it and at least the other two have real benefits to upgrade. There is no real life advantage to upgrade at bumble.
Aritra Roy,Better than Tinder and hinge combined lol
C J,"Congratulations, Bumble. You managed to create an app more useless than Tinder. 👏"
Pat OneGuy,"The app is buggy, causing swiping to be unavailable for days on end, they charge more than Tinder without really delivering anything worthwhile, and if you aren't paying they seem to actively keep anyone who has swiped on you out of your feed to try to create a soft paywall."
Majora489,"I intended to use the app's subscription for one month. Everything on my account indicated that my subscription would end on December 5th. Hidden within the terms and conditions, Bumble can auto renew your subscription. Additionally, even if you delete the app Bumble can still charge you. Bumble uses underhanded legalize to get your money for a sub-par experience. I'm in my 20s and male. I thought I created profile that display my personality well. Within the month on Bumble, I received maybe 5 likes. I started using Tinder; 12 likes within the first few hours. I actually get responses from women on Tinder. There are more worthwhile apps and at lower costs too."
Fionna Fox,2021 and I'm back to bumble and it's worse. I can't like people or super like anything for more than 10 mintues And your charging $150 for a year? This is not tinder. Your suppose to be better.. lame af.
jake daly,"Better than tinder because there less bits but unless you loom like Manuel Ferrara your not gonna get a natural match, only gonna get paid matches and even the it's not enough matches that send the first message[lady's message boys]. Better tha. Tinder but you'd better be prepared to ""date down"" if you want ""a lot of dates."""
Vipul Sharma,I would definitely give this app a ONE star rating as I personally believe that this application is the biggest scam after TINDER. I have brought weekly subscriptions as well to check if it works but I never received a single match in the last 7-8 months usage. I did receive few additional benefits after buying the subscription but it's of no use. I would recommend everyone to opt for other apps rather than going for this one.
Fl4kZZ Entertaiment,"Steep costs for everything. Not as bad as tinder tho. For my brother's out there, always approach dating apps with one thing in mind: they want your money. Don't get lost king's"
Carmelo Rivera,"Used to be good but now 98% of the profiles are obviously fake. Reporting fake profiles even when they are completely fake doesn't yield results, even for paid subscriptions all you'll get is flocked by these fake profiles as if the algorithm uses you to report them. This app is not too far from being overrun by fake profiles looking to promote IG and SC accounts just like Tinder. It's easy ban social media handles or usernames completely, maybe you'll have less profiles but better quality."
Ryan King,"The window for communication is too small. You may as well head to the 24/7 supermarket at 4am for only 6 minutes hoping you'll find your soulmate. If you match, she has 24 hours to respond, but chances are she will not log into the app in time to respond and neither will you to extend her. In the years I've used this I'm struggling to think of any time I've actually met a match or chatted. It's sad relying on greedy tinder but at least I meet people there and we can message at our leisure."
N,"Somehow worse than Tinder, didn't think that was possible."
Taylor G,"They claim to operate on personality but allow for about as many characters in bio as Tinder. The first screen that loads is a payment plan offer EVERY TIME. They also have the worst ad delivery mechanism, which in my case was sending a notification that I had a match and presenting me with an ad when I clicked it. Be a less bad cash grab."
Bob Hazy,Better than Match and Tinder.
Dylan Foster,"I love bumble, I met my current girlfriend of 2 years and we wouldve never met if it wasn't for this app. I was tired of matching with people on tinder and when I would reach out trying to hang out with girls I'd get left on read. I like how on bumble the girl has to start the conversation when you match. Maybe that's just me but what can I say, I've only been in the best relationship of my life for 2 years because of this app. Thank you bumble!"
Corey Donaldson,"Just like tinder, this app clearly doesn't show you in other people's algorithms, unless you pay. You get tons of ""likes"" which you can't see or interact with until you pay. Basically useless unless you pay."
WhaTube,"Waste of time. Matches are paywalled. Try tinder instead. Edit: developer replied saying matches are free. Why is it the case then that seeing who likes you costs money, and the profiles that like you never seem to pop up in your feed 🤔 Edit 2: reinstalled the app the find 4 likes. I widened my preferences RIGHT up and started swiping left on every profile that wasn't obviously them. Found the first 2 almost instantly. Spent the next hour only to not even find the other 2. Bit sus yeah?"
will SEd,Im a great looking guy. Never matched on bumble. So guys get 10 swipes and girls are unlimited? Thats sexist asf. No wonder ive had the app for 4 months and never matched. Very poor app im going back to tinder.
John Doe,"There doesn't seem to be much activity on this app. My Tinder account (same pictures, similar bio, etc.) easily gets at least 3 times as many matches. And when I do match with someone, they just let the match expire without starting the conversation. Or maybe they just never got the memo?"
James Luquette,"I used Bumble years ago and it was fine back then (actually met a very good friend thanks to bumble), however it doesn't seem to be worth the time now. I've had bumble for an entire month and I have literally not gotten 1 single match at all. Yet other apps like Tinder and Facebook dating I've gotten plenty of matches. Not sure what the deal is, seems like you have no luck unless you're willing to pay overpriced subscriptions. Maybe you can have better luck than me, but I recommend other apps."
Joseph Mckinney,"Just as tinder, it gives you some type of advantage when talking confidence seeing how many women I match with helps it real and I guess if you simp for women and only fans thin this isn't anything trust me ""!"
Charles D,Bumble is trash! Accounts get deleted after a day and there is absolutely no customer support. Honestly Tinder is better now
david mellors,"My review keeps getting deleted. Very feminist app. Anti guys. They ban you for little to no reason, They give you zero feedback on your ban then they link your pictures and card details to the banned account. Just use Tinder instead"
Deni Kovacs,"The swiping motion is uncontrollable, 2 times out of 10. You simply touch the screen and it immediately swipes left, but you gonna end up looking like your grandma on facebook, with the pointer finger if you wanna swipe intentionally. Cause it doesn't do what you want it to do. Way worse than tinder's swiping motion. Also, it's extremely left wing based and regulated, based on the values of snowflakes."
Nick Bredenkamp,"Better than tinder, and around a good app. Met my girlfriend on it so I'd recommend."
Tibs Garcia,Better than tinder
vignesh vichu,Not matches happening like Tinder. Had huge expectations that it would be better than Tinder but totally disappointed
Powdered-Toast Man,"I hate online dating sites, I only got this bc my friends wouldn't stop bugging me to get it. It's a cool concept, but it went as expected only getting matches with bots :/. Lowered it to 1 star bc apparently getting premium is pointless. You get to see who likes you but you don't get at least one spotlight free? Tinder gives you one free boost and 5 super likes along with unlimited swipes and seeing who liked you before matching. Greedy."
Rubaya Afzal,Excellent. Less creepy than tinder. Gives the power/decision taking into women's hands.
G Luke Harris,"Tried over and over and over to log back in to my old account, but when I try to set it back up I get to the profile picture, try to select a picture, and all it says is ""Something went wrong..."". I've tried over and over for YEARS to see if it would ever fix itself and it never did. I'd much rather use this app over Tinder but at least Tinder actually you know... WORKS so... this app sucks."
SOULLESS KING,Garbage... Literally more expensive than the other apps only to never have a match and when you do they never message so it expires and by the time you have to pay again you have gained nothing but lost more money than you would have for the same thing on tinder except ive actually met people on tinder so yeah trashy app
Travis Kurtzi,Way better than tinder!
Uncle Sly,"Used to be decent and it's only getting worse now. It's always because of money, all these dating apps don't really want you to match and be happy :( you would leave and stop paying. There is worse for sure ( tinder). But this is the most sexist app if you are a man I once had a conversation with an awful rude troubled woman i was only polite. She reported me ( I didn't ) threatened me and they gave me warning for it? I mean cmon I was the polite one! I emailed them and they didn't care. Biased You use ai to review conversations and give back copy and pasted replies to complains."
rory coleman,Better than tinder anyway
Kristin Allen,Sooo much better than Tinder!
B L,Just another one of the plethora of garbage dating apps plaguing the love life of America. Go meet people outside. Also cookie cutter tinder/okcupid with maybe 25 or 30 likes a day lol. What a joke
Zac Likes Cauliflower,This app is just sub-par Tinder lol
Chi Phạm,Worst dating app ever. The social here sound more healthy than tinder but i cant upload my picture even it is follow all the rule. How can i find a right guy when i cant upload my cutest pic and it is not even sexy at all
Nikhil Deshpande,Noone going to notice here. And noone going to message you here. Tinder is best atles I got 10-12 messages and meet up as well. BUMBLE is here only to fool you. DONT INSTALL IT MY FRIEND.
A,"An improved model from Tinder and co. The filters could work better: to exclude people who selected a category, not include only those people who selected an option. The way it currently works, you exclude people who leave fields blank. Also, ""Liberal"" means something different outside of US - you need to internationalize/regionalize better."
Samuel Caballero,All the pain of Tinder but none of the matches
Deandra Neretlis,"I like the function to turn off dating. But quite frankly, I'm used to Tinder. The setup here is not easy, you have to double tap the photo to read, vs Tinder the bio is there and you only double tap for more pics. I can't stand the feature where you have to message within 24 hours, it just does not work when people are busy. This only promotes people redirecting matches to IG or SC, which I don't have, and I'm looking for in person friends, not some random new follow on social media."
Kiley Brown,Better than tinder.
Mantas Navickas,"The idea is decent but the execution is poor. The app just doesn't have enough people using it and Bumble really strong hands you into buying their premium features otherwise you are likely not getting any matches... A shame, but I'd suggest using their competitors like Tinder, Badoo or Hinge."
Stefan Ilivanov,Another Tinder clone without much real profiles and which high prices for every function which should be free
matthew peru,"So I was on bumble for one month. In that time I have come to the conclusion that the majority of women on this app don't understand its function. Their profiles are filled with I will not message you, you message me first. A majority of the women on this app are misunderstanding the app. You might say maybe nobody likes you the problem is the same women were on tinder or other dating sites and they did respond when I messaged first. So I can't blame the app just the people on the app."
Nishant Singh,"after log in, app asks for a photo but problem is my photos dont upload after multiple tries. clicking on support doesnt work as it says email does not exist. frustrating app. back to tinder."
Deepen Wadhwa,"My only complaints are that the premium service is a bit too expensive and you get seen by less and less people as the days go by, premium or not, but that's about it! This is wayyy better than Tinder still. Tinder stole my money twice without any refund or upgrade..."
Iliad Hera,"No one is serious about connecting with people on here. I've moved across the country and been in a lot of different cities so far but everytime I've used this app, I get ghosted after a few days. I don't know if it's the way the notifications work or the intent of the people I match with but it feels like this app is missing the aspect of personal connection unbridled by physical appearance. It feels like a shallow friend app. Its just tinder for friendships honestly 🤷‍♀️"
Mark Vydra,"I signed up and was rarely active. One day I opened the app when I planned to use it more and I was banned for making offensive comments, which at the time I may e had 1 or 2 matches... One of which was a friend who matched me as a gag. Tried contacting support about the ban and I never even received an inquiry. Use tinder or hinge instead."
Malcom Dooney,Told all my mates they defame guys and block men for no reason because you didn't like someone on there that's a constant stalker so all my mates which is lots wont use non equality fairnessn apps and have gone back to tinder and POF Badoo blender etc One sided app banning men for no reason just because one girl doesn't like you on there. Men go back to tinder movement #mgtow That's why they have heaps of 1 stars stupid gender bias app
Yashraj Chokshi,This app is literally a scam seems like no one is active in here and it's just waste of your own time by being on this app . Don't install this app. Better tinder is less worse than this app
Ace van Cleef,"Reading profile is enjoyable and better structured than on Tinder. What I wish bumble improves are: 1) Increase spotlight duration to 2 hours or more 2) After 24h run out, give men the opportunity to take the initiative, simply because most women prefer men taking the first step. This is how they are socially conditioned and thus Bumble's approach is well-intended but leads to actually having no text convo even getting started. Uhoh."
Larry Peters,It's damn bear impossible to meet anyone. There's TONS and TONS of fake profiles. It's just a boring dating app. Just as bad as Tinder
Eric Maiden,2 swipes a day is all you get and they steel your information tinder is better.
Abhishek,Worse than tinder for sure
GB 988,Better than tinder
joshua maust,"I've used tinder, iris, hinge, and bumble and ive gotten far fewer results with this. Results meaning actual real human beings to talk to."
Nachiket K,Tinder is way better. No option to see all the right swiped profiles at a glance as in Tinder. I can decide to super swipe based on what options I have in total.
franckmat,Really go better than tinder
Cameron Steel,"It is a good way to see what your preferences are in dating and making friends. Having the girl make the move is a great feature. However, the only part of bumble that I do not like is having to pay to see who likes you. This feature should be free. The only thing you need to do is make seeing who likes you free while increasing the price for subscriptions, superswipes and spotlight. I can gaurantee more people will use the app and rival tinder if the viewing of people who like you is free."
John Somerlott,A) I just got threatened to have my account suspended because I tried to post a young picture of me and for one with friends??? B) The matching algorithm seems mutch more of a cash grab than Tinder & Hinge. C) some days it says there is nobody in my area but I have a strong feeling that is not the case because the next day I'll have a couple dozen before I run out of swipes.
Gilberto Quiroz-Rea,"Overall much better than Tinder, the app is what you make of it. I subscribed to Premium & although don't match with everyone I'd like, the quality of people are much better than other apps. Be warned, they don't do refunds & if you react to someone's photo it automatically likes them which really upset me. I'd give 5 stars if they allowed us to upgrade previous like to a Super swipe (since it doesn't allow rewinds on likes), & if it lets you react to a photo while Super swiping instead of like"
Esohe Odigie,Easy to use and fun! Don't mind the negative reviews. This is wayyyyyyyy better than tinder even! I hope they're here to stay .
Rama krishna Dutt,It's actually waaaaay better than Tinder!!
Stone Cold,"Very very bad application, It has very few swipes and takes very long time to get refresh to the new swipes. I have been using Bumble from last 9 10 months nobody matches at all. If they match they dont send you message, and if they send you message they unmatch within an hour. Totally waste of time and money. You get nothing from this app. Atleast Tinder gives you some match than this app."
Tyler Kendall,"Don'tttttttttt waste your money! I bought spotlight for a couple bucks, and I got 3 likes!!!! 3 likes!!!! I'll share my experience, I've had tinder before and used spotlight, I ended up getting 15 matches and 25 Likes in the same time period as bumble uses their spotlight. What a rip off"
Vince Silva,"What used to be an amazing app has chosen to go down the route that tinder has. If you don't pay for add ons you don't get the exposure. I'm a paid subscriber who used to get approx 25 likes per day, but now due to changes in the app's algorithm that's down to 4 a day. Emailed them 4 times and fobbed off each time. A shame really."
Icy Queen,Better quality than tinder
DarkerThan Black,"Great Value Tinder Not only do you have to match with people at a high enough percentage; you also need to wait until your match initiates the conversation which is also another layer of number games. Then, unless you pay, you're unlikely to ever see all your hidden likes no matter how much you swipe. Defintely feels like they stall account viewe and interactions. They certainly can boost them.."
Vasilios Magriplis,"It's Tinder except the woman has to message first within 24 hours. Problem is most matches expire without the woman ever initiating contact, which gets old fast. Combine that with the profiles that are clearly on there to promote their Instagram, and you're left with an app that's even less effective than Tinder for dating (which is already a very low bar)."
Killer Bee,"App bans me for not being 18 even though I'm 19 (20 now) and now I can't access the app at all. I even created a new account whicb could only be done via a facebook account and after not using the app for literally 1 week, I am locked out once again. This app does nothing but waste time every single chance it gets. Just use tinder, as bad as it is."
Matthew Millar,"I regularly get hit on by women on the street age 26-56 and have had great success with dating. Using Bumble was a joke. I had 5% of the matches with Tinder. Dating apps in general are DEAD don't waste your time and money. I put significant effort into creating a compelling profile, and I'm in the top 1% of men in game/looks/status."
Rahib Raza,"The app doesn't show u many ppl in any area, nothing's free and the filters do not work. Its not even close to tinder but tinder doesn't work in Pakistan, so no use"
Craig Nicol,"Used to be a fair dating app but now it isn't giving you as many matches, no 24 hour timer and constantly pushing the daily matches back more and more time so you are inclined to buy the full version. Started moderating my beach photos for nudity and yet you see more and more girls with micro bikinis in photos... bit sexist there. Anyway, better off on tinder now"
Lennart Kehrberger,"Dadurch das beide Seiten schreiben müssen, verhindert die App das man aus Schreibfaulheit Matches sammelt und stattdessen tatsächlich ins schreiben kommt und eventuell sogar trifft. Durch Bumble hatte ich trotz weniger Matches mehr Dates wie durch Tinder."
Julio Corpeno,"Update: I've met lots of quality girls and have Gone on wonderful dates with them. Bumble's customer support is outstanding! As opposed to tinder which, has no customer support. I highly recommend Bumble! Everything is perfect, but I can't find the option to get bumble premium for 24 hrs anymore. Did that get removed?"
Nigel H.,Slightly better than Tinder.
Chris,"The unique idea of this app is that women need to make the first step after matching (same swipe principle as Tinder or other apps). However it seems like they are not making this clear to the female users: Although having a vast amount of matches around 90% (yes, even more) won't contact you. If they do they complain they always have to do the first step. Some women even write they expect the man to take initiative. Conclusion: this concept won't work without proper user education."
Oliver Nuttall,"Seems dead, out of the matches I got a good 80% don't even message within the 24 hour period they have. Happens far too often Oh and if you want to cancel your premium make sure you check the tiny, nondescript ""active until"" button which is ridiculously unclear that it is actually the management button or you'll get charged for extra that you don't even want Don't bother, out of Tinder and Hinge this has been the absolute worst of those three for matches and conversation"
Jeremiah Owens,"I'm attractive I've had pleanty of dates on tinder and okc, ive never had a single match that i was interested enough to date that texted me within the short window of alotted time on this site. Women HAVE TO make the first move, which is not really the norm and they have 24 hours to notice you matched and respond, really seems like they didnt think this one through before throwing tons of money at it, if you have any issues the support staff wines ""we can't do anything for you"""
Sybrand van Wyk,Much better than Tinder. Wish more women matched me though. Guess I'll have to get an app to improve my profile.
Dukedipper 423,Tinder's better. This app will block your account if a match even remotely reports you. And fyi dont waste any money on it
Larks Tongues In Aspic,"Bumble algorithm kinda sucks. It brings the most desirable people to top of the cards, so if you're not in the top 10% desirable people, chances are you won't even show up in people's queues. And people who WOULD swipe right on you and like your style, will actually never see your profile. Unlike Tinder which puts people with similar level of desirability on top of each other's queues and that way even if your profile isn't super popular, at least it's still being seen and you will have matches"
Naisarg Raval,Honestly I had much expectations with this app but NO. I'm giving this app 1 star because it doesn't provide much even after purchasing premium plan. I think even spotlight and superlike don't work. You can't even reverse a person you've just liked if you want to change your mind. It only works if you dislike them. If you want to spend the money spend it on Tinder. It's better than this.
James Symmonds,"Same as tinder with an added issue. Like tinder, it's trying to do a cash grab. You can tell it you aren't interested in someone but it'll try to get you to buy a package because you missed a match. No I didn't, I swiped left for a good reason. I'm not missing anything. The added fun though is that women have to make the first move. Despite many matches, that rarely happens."
clark main,"Wish I could give it zero stars. Don't waste your money, it's garbage. A bunch of fake profiles just telling you to follow them on social media, worse than Tinder. The app won't refund any money either. Total trash."
Jake Smith,"Add an timer that shows how long it will be before users can start swiping again. Tinder has a countdown timer, bumble does not."
Travis,"Eh, it is what it is. If you're not a 15/10 Chad in the top 5% you're better off not wasting your time on dating apps. Seriously. Or at least don't take it seriously, because women are..... Yeah. You got a better chance asking women you see in person. I implore you to Google 'reddit tinder insights' and see how the game is stacked against 95-98% of men. Good luck brothers."
Andy Coffer,Might as well be tinder. Just a complete waste of time. They probably sell your info to China.
suraj jejurkar,"Bumble, Tinder, Happn - Pathetic, Fake apps.Just waste of time & money."
Sándor Németh,"It's unclear for girls that they have to write first on this app. Otherwise it could be better than tinder but far less people uses it. Europe specific problems (that are true for tinder aswell): all girls are in that one big city. If you live in Austria, you can bet that every girl lives in Wien. Idk if its a cultural thing or ""hot city girl"" syndrome but you can only use these apps if you live in the biggest city in your country."
peter S,"App steals money from you and Bumble refuses refund. Reported to Google Play for shady business practices. Tried it again now after a few years. Site is almost as bad as Tinder now. Mostly fake profiles and chat bots that ""Hi I'm xxxx. How was your day?"" Then literally any response beyond ""it was good"" results in the bot bugging out and ending conversation."
Benjamin Young,Well it's better than Tinder.
kenjamin,"10/10 would not recommend unless your EX is dead or you are somehow friends. 1st time I downloaded bumble I was on for a few weeks, matched with a few women and was having good conversations when my account got banned. No way to appeal, and after going on line and hunting down how to reach out to bumble on the matter I was given no info on why I was banned. Cheated the system and set a new profile, only made it a week and was banned. Atleast on tinder you have to match in order to report."
Sourav Dash,"Download tinder instead , worst match making algorithm"
Akash Chaudhari,Better than tinder
Aleksei Gerassimov,"Typical dating app: you have matches, but to be matched you have to pay. Otherwise they won't be shown to you. Just another Tinder-like guys trying to make money"
DJ MeechyMeech,This app feels like it has maybe 90% less people than tinder. But it's better than tinder because the connections seem more genuine. Tinder is just a big scam and waste of money. Tinder will ban you for no reason. Bubble seems to be more reliable.
Kashif,Pathetic dating app. No matter how good your profile is or you buy subscription. It won't give you matches. It seems like a straight scam. Editing my review just to inform you that I have already sent you multiple emails but you never reply on them. Tinder is far better than this!!
Aria Dickson,Tinder is free an you can choose up to what distance to find people but have to pay for locations on bumble..very disappointing cant set distance range on bumble for free like Tinder
Divya Modi,Stuck on a page. Can't go back forth. Dafuq guys i don't wanna go to Tinder.
Neeraj Chimwal,"I don't know why people are giving bad ratings to this app. I love this application. It's so much better than tinder. And this new bizz feature, hats off to you guys. UI is clean, it's user friendly and it has amazing features."
Luke Anderson,"People actually have normal conversations on this app, I strongly recommend buying premium for a week because you only need a day to get an actual irl date. If you use tinder you get ghosted for trying to get to know someone through having a normal conversation and getting a match gets you no where."
zikesok lord,"Hi Bumble, thanks for responding back to everyone. I don't why you think we users don't understand how to use your basic app. The fact male pics have female bio description and are not checked before being shown is absured. If user asked for only opposited sex thats what he/she should recive tinder does. Another problem is that there is no way to know if a user is active. Meetme/Skout shows a green icon to active users and allow you to message that person letting them know your intrested."
Kon Yan,"It works better than tinder for me. Gives me an instant match and leaves the messaging to the other half, in my case the girl. So it's a good app, just more expensive than tinder if you can't wait and rather pay."
Jakob Sjoberg,"The app works really well the first couple of days and gives some matches. But after that there are no new matches. I tried to pay for boosts, but they don't give any effect. I think that boost doesn't work anywhere near as well as it does on Tinder. So it is an app that is nice to have for a few days, delete it, and start all over, but it gives no effect to pay."
Francesco Salvi,Haven't had a single match (for dating) even filling all the info and verifying the profile. Not even the fake ones you usually receive on tinder. Prolly it's even more pay to match (haven't tried tho)
Kunj Somaiya,Better than tinder
Francisco Melfi,"Everyday the getting worst. I can't verify my age because a bug of your app! The camera says ""strength up"" and never take the picture! The app used to be great. Now is horrible like tinder."
Keifer,"So typical dating app scam just like tinder and all the others out there. They have the fake ""check who likes you"" payment that should be reported for scamming. As well they have limited swipes now. I would love to see these companies sued for all the money they scam out of people. I don't understand how this is even legal."
Michael Clarke,Why ask for money when this app doesn't even work? Maybe I should try tinder 🤦.
Abhiraj Singh,I have met more people through bumble than through. Tinder. So thank you bumble.
Harrison Scarth,Wouldn't let me connect on either mobile data or WiFi no issues with tinder and badoo just this
Lou Vrecaire,"Well the Dating part is absolutely useless for men, clearly. You can at least get matches on Tinder... The Business side was somewhat interesting, however not nearly as fruitful as I had hoped."
Rafael Torres Egea,This app is a garbage like tinder
Jonix,"Every N times you swipe left, you get a fake message ""You missed a match"". It is fixed. Really, Bumble? Everything's behind a pay wall. It is way more expensive than Tinder, and it has less girls on the platform. App itself is slick though, easy to use and smooth."
Aditya Sharma,"Doesn't make sense. I'm a 6'2"" male who has relatively no problem in getting matches in Tinder but here in Bumble I only ever got 1 match which was a fake account. I even use your spotlight feature for 0 success."
gwenda perez,"DO NOT GET PREIUM ADD ONS!!! YOU CAN NEVER GET THEM TO STOP.BILLING YOU! IVE SENT REPEATED REQUESIT'S TO NO AVAIL.. NOT only has it ruined dating. Now men don't feel the need to pursue or date. It's made women become desperate. There are more men on here looking for a one night stand than tinder. It's sad that is has ruined a man's desire for the hunt . Now he has become a lazy lion that has the ""women"" bring him the food. It's made men lazy! Sadly if you want a sincere relationship,goTinder"
Arminda Gaor,NOT FREE AT ALL 🤣🥱🤦‍♀️I'm better off with Tinder. At least I get to talk to people without paying a cent. ✌
Ariana Tansley,"Dont bother using this app. Go on tinder or hinge. They charged me for the 1 day subscription despite me cancelling it. They claim I cancelled it 4 days later, which literally didnt happen? I wasnt even on the app that day yet they took payment from me for 4 days. Theres no clear indication on WHERE to cancel your subscription too, they pretty much hide it-- according to my online search on their SCAMMING ways."
Riddhi Sawant,Great app but it really needs to refresh the matches that appear. Sometimes I don't wanna do left or even right. I just wanna skip for the time being and later try my luck. No refresh of matches like in tinder is a major turnoff. Please fix this team bumble!!!!!!!
Corey Collins,"I'm one of the many people with the issue of Beeline (Admirers) not working. I've had Bumble for some time and have traveled to a few different states and haven't had a single person ever appear in the beeline. I use Tinder and Hinge and get a decent amount of likes there so i know it's not just me being unattractive lol. Please repair servers or upgrade them or whatever needs to happen, i feel like I'm not popping up in other accounts feed."
Daniel Wiggins,I like that there's different options for the people you're trying to meet and that you can customize your profile a little bit more than tinder. But I don't know why it wants me to connect my Instagram so bad when I don't even have Instagram on my phone and that's not even an app that everyone has. Not to mention that Facebook disabled embedded browser login which your app still uses making it entirely useless and impossible to use Facebook for any kind of login.
Maurice V,"This app gets scummier and scummier, all they want to do is steal your money. You have to wait forever to start swyping again, woman don't start the conversation so if you match you rarely get to chat to them and if they do message you, you message back and forth a couple of times and that's it, they no longer respond. I have never met anyone from this app but have met quite a few from Tinder and others. Don't waste your time and don't waste your money. It's just a scam"
Ruthless Gaming,Basically tinder costs to much too
fairbaaa,"Bumble is feminism gone wrong. They brag about the amount of men they block permanently from their app for ""breaking their community guidlines"" but more and more you'll find that men that are good people get blocked for no reason. Poorly designed community, app, and experience. Whitney Wolfe (creator) was tossed from tinder and went on to ""make"" bumble. It's a failure if you've ever tried using this app and their stock price is reflecting their poor performance being 27% down year to date."
Carly James,I like that it's less hookup culture compared to tinder.
Shynobi Renfro,"Ok. Bumble is supposed to be a dating/ social gathering place to meet, advance careers, ect. Don't do it if you're a male. Seriously, you'll just want to punch yourself in the face. I was told that this is about female empowerment. I'd honestly be more impressed with equality. Don't waste time or money here. At least Tinder or POF TRIES to match you up. Even if they are bots."
Priyank. Busa,It is the best dating app that works for Boys and girls ... Girls make the first move ... unlike Tinder where things never clicks.
kelly richardson,"I get matches all day long on tinder, but zilch on bumble. I suspect a large proportion of profiles are fake. Waste of time. Update:. Oct 2021 and this app is still hot garbage."
Liz L,Tries sooo hard to be different from Tinder lol. They show you chats of people that unmatch you instead of just letting them disappear so it can be rubbed in even more. What a ridiculous feature.
Heather Christiansen,Heaps better than Tinder !
harshal pawar,"Better than tinder, for sure."
Andrew Angus,The app has crashed and won't even show my profile or load at any time j have to constantly uninstall and reinstall to even start swiping also if you run out of swipes im on day 2 now still not able to connect with anyone really buggy app. It seems also bumble have a 1 reply suits all approach to ratings and comments very hands off approach I think I'll go pay for tinder instead very disappointing
wesley Blum,Works as well as Tinder
Raj Annamwar,"This platforms are useless until you pay.They will make sure you pay even to see who swiped right.I did fall for this trap on Tinder ,but once subscribed I can see no one swiped right.dont fall for trap if you are not superman kind guy..Just meet people physically through common interest.."
Raven Goodspeed,"Literally can't even use the app. Tried to contact support, nothing. Everyone I upload an image of myself, even on I took right there on the spot, it gets denied. I COULDNT EVEN GET MY ACCOUNT SETUP!!!! Pass this app, and hit hinge or even tinder. Screw this junk. Make an app that works, please and thank you."
Robert Rivard,"Hahah by far the biggest waste of time hands down, better off using hinge, tinder, etc. This app was designed for snowflakes, you post anything literally pg rated and it can and will be deleted. The app makes it difficult to even speak with anyone. Save yourself the time and effort of the set up!"
Plant Power,"Be careful when paying, even for one day, they will keep charging you daily without notice. This is a scam app. Tinder way better and more transparent. Avoid!"
Wrx_ Mason,Horrible app cant use any pictures going back to hinge and tinder ✌
Kelly Young,"Worse than Tinder! Despite matching with people, nobody ever responds to messages. Absolute waste of time & effort."
Mohd azhad shaikh,Worst app even with premium subscription buy tinder premium you will get a match for sure
James Cody,"From a man's pov... this app is best. But I'd also recommend premium, and I only say that because we're limited in that we don't take the first move. So getting premium helped me alot. As far as tinder, POF and OKC are concerned, this app wins..... but I've never tried Match yet. Lol"
Peter Harjung,A disappointing experience. I used the app for a month and payed for extras on a few occasions. On the positive side there seems to be actual people on the app with good matches. However men have almost no chance on this app I only matched twice and the match never bothered to start the conversation. I had a regular profile too without too many red flags I hope. Better than Tinder but still not great.
Dorian,"As far as online dating goes, this is probably the best app to use. It much better than Tinder, though that is setting the bar very low. The 24h chance to reconsider makes for less but more engaging interactions, so it feels like less time wasted. I do get the impression that a lot of profiles haven't logged in a long time and are very basic, but the app keeps showing them to keep you swiping."
Jake Fenton,This and tinder are designed to mess with u so u get the premium and still get nowhere it's such a scam
omkar gosavi,Used to be good before 3-4 months now it became just like tinder.
A Google user,Keeps showing me males and showing me TO males when I clearly state I'm a lesbian. Just as worse as tinder. Rip.
Hunter Wriston,"Can't even upload a profile picture. Every single one I've tried has been flagged for ""violating guidelines'' how?? Is my face that ugly y'all can't upload it lmao. Stick to tinder"
clayton buck,Way better than Tinder. Much easier to find a match and a lot less fake accounts and spammers.
Rommie Leo,"The exposure is very very low, almost everything is monetized, used it for a month, paid almost 50 sgd and could find anyone that can hold up a chat. Compared to tinder and CMB, those are way better exposure and there will be new connections for me almost everyday. Going to delete this useless app."
Sima Ștefan,Better than tinder. Girls make the first move so u know they will actually be interested in interacting
Brandon Agnew,The app definitely offers better results when it comes to funding a high quality match than tinder does. I really enjoy it for the simple fact that its easy.
Michael Brunner,"Sure, it doesn't have the same usercount as tinder (surely not every woman is into the concept of writing the first message), but talking just about the app, the usability and features are top in my opinion 👍"
Margareth Emile,my account was randomly banned. on my birthday of all days. thank you bigoted staff for listening to random reports and not even investigating. i will not be returning as i have spent too much time and money on this racist app. i recommend Taimi and tinder even to non binary people. Bumble is disgusting from the staff to the people all blind with privilege.
John,"I find less fake profiles than Tinder, but I can't filter out guys from my results even though I've selected looking for women. I only have to swipe left, but it's annoying to think that for all the hours spent swiping through women, I have to also waste my time swiping through guys too."
JKJAIN :LIFE CHANGING VIDEOS jk jain,Tinder is better but can improve
Nathan Mah,"Great, if you want to endlessly scroll through pictures. Not so great if you ever want to match with someone. For all Tinder's problems, at least I get some matches. If it's a play to get folks to spend money, then surely you'd want to give them a match or two first? Seems to just be broken as is. Update: Developer responds by critiquing my profile? Basically, ""Hey, your profile must be completely unlikeable, maybe we can help you with that."" Um, I said your competitors, despite problems, actually match people together. Pretty sure my profile could be young Leo DiCaprio and I'd still not get a match on this app lol."
Douglas s,"Update October 8 2021: Newest version of bumble is terrible. Why did you shrink the pics. Bumble was unique. Now it is sorry and just like Tinder. I can tell you already. I will be using the software less, not more. Where is the option to like someones pic or words? Loser IT Tech folks always ruin good software. Stick with what works and don't become another microsoft just for the sake of change. Updates suck."
_,"-Unlike HINGE they do not offer as a filter to choose what ethnicity\culture(catagorie) you seek -ALSO don't like the swipe option like tinder- hinge does it better -i prefer hinge in all respects especially the lay out for, sex\age\children\drugs- -nice thing about HINGE-I can upload a 10-15sec vid, amazing! -only reason I am using bumble to see if there is a wider dating pool\participants...the platform use\layout makes it so undesirable to participate... Hinge is limited but clear\utilitarian"
Drippy Leakage,"Location doesn't even work, said i was 3 hours away from where i lived. Fake adds saying you have all these profiles that have liked your account, but if you pay for a subscription magically they've all disappeared. All the profiles that you do match with are either fake profiles or just fake people. Love the concept behind the app, but the developers mucked this up so bad you're better off downloading tinder."
Cibconnor,Worse then tinder 👍 girls match but don't message
Juan Velozo,"***DONT USE THIS APP*** It is seriously the worst app I have ever seen/used. The app is bad, expensive, and there are not many people on it. It is NOT better than Tinder. It is a very weak and poor version of Tinder. DO NOT use this app. The customer service is awful and everything for them is ""based on the T/Cs"". This means that they will trick you. DO NOT use it. Im giving 1 star as there isn't an option to give ZERO. Disgusting app. Simply Disgusting. Horrible ""customer service"" too."
Harry Haddow,Better selection of people than I was expecting. Tinder isn't great in Dallas. Hinge is utter trash. Bumble seems ok so far
Boss Smith,"Pretty much tinder,must pay to see likes Wich defeats the purpose of a free dating app"
Mark Marcarian,Not having any luck here at all. I di much better on Tinder and FB dating. I'm definitely dissatisfied.
Eric Tinder,"Fair, clear and transparent. Plus it is somehow a pleasure and relief that, as a man, the women are the only one to be able to make the first move. Implying they read (and approved) your Bio. -> Quite a relief compared to Tinder, its obnoxious atmosphere & vibes of a Meat Market; not to mention 1/3 of their women in Stockholm are from Thailand, 8000km away... PS: my signature is ""Eric Tinder"" as I use an ""Eric123.tinder@..."" account for dating apps only. I do not work for them nor Bumble."
Raul Orbai,"The idea is great, but it's using the same tricks as Tinder! Algorithm that favours certain types of people and encouragement to pay up for more likes."
Diego Silva,Blocked for no reason. Tinder is better anyways.
The Anonymous,"I purchased premium for endless, I deleted my account to start a fresh. My new account don't have premium. I tried contacting support via E-mail and on twitter. There is hardly a reply and even that says it's not refundable while I asked for a redeeming the subscription to my new account. Very poor customer service. I would suggest use Tinder instead."
irene jelicich,This app is way better than tinder people on here actually want a serious relationship .
Lewy Sav,"more likely to have a drop bear chuck us a bundy than get a match on bumble. If you do match don't expect a reply to your msg. P.s I get matches and hook ups on tinder, so it can't be my ugly mug holding me back."
MegaPoppy1991,"So far it's ok but there's barely anyone on it. I went through everyone there is in under 1 hour. And there isn't an option to explore other locations like Tinder either, unless you pay for the premium version."
Nik Rickley,"found my amazing girlfriend thanks to this app, much more profile customization than tinder which I found easier to determine someone's interests and similarities. the option to look for friends as well as a partner is different in a great way unlike many other apps that pick one or the other"
Pascual Jean-louis,"Better than tinder ,"
brado jacko,The algorithm rarely ever shows you your actual matches and limits your swipes and constantly demands dumb upsell items. This is not meaningfully different from tinder. Stop dating in the online simulation. Go meet someone in the real world. It is far easier and more entertaining than this.
Alec Robinson,Worst app ever. Even worse than Tinder. Matches are all fake or just bots trying to get you to buy nudes from a fake site.
Big Pigeon,"I mean it's good, but it's way better than Tinder in my opinion. But I'm into women and it's showing me Men within the list... Idk why... Idk how... But it just is..."
Selina Baidya,"This app has gone so downhill. They blocked me despite verifying me. And won't let me sign up again without giving me a reason why I've been blocked after taking money. This app will ask you to pay, take your money then block you. Do not waste your time and money on this app. You're better off sticking to hinge or tinder. Also I think they keep our data such as photos even after deleting our profiles. They are dodgy as hell.. stay away from this app."
maku gx,"1) it STEALS stars you pay for. I've seen this happen many times. 2) It goes offline when you turn off your GPS (which kills your battery) Sadly, best dating app since tinder."
Ryan Alton,"I came from Tinder's platform. Thank God this app exists. Tinder was full of only fans, cam models, outright prostitution and I'm pretty sure they're not doing a thing about it. It's frustrating because I'm paying for it to meet people not sift through manure. Thank you Bumble for a much better experience. 5 stars"
O T,"This app is infinitely better than Tinder and FB dating. Those apps will ban you based on bogus reports. So far, bumble is just better in every way. Women message guys first, you don't have to worry about them deleting your account once you've spent money on it, and the app kind of artificially forces you to keep a conversation going - or unmatch.... So you get less dead matches than other apps. Would recommend."
Wai Guin Lam,"Bumble account blocked for no reason stating reported. Considering not having had any matches or interactions absolute joke. Dont waste your time, use Tinder. Much better"
Kendra Mullen,I have had several negative experiences on this app. I thought this was a bit above POF and other apps- but nah. Scammers and liars and people who just want nothing more than a booty call. May as well download Tinder.
Jonathan Anderson,"Bumble operate an unethical business model where, if you want to try out premium, you can purchase a day, week or month. Obviously if you want it for just one day, you would pick one day. What they then do is keep the subscription running so you get charged every day until you realise and then refuse to refund you or acknowledged it's unethical. This rate works out a lot more than a week or month and they obviously make money ftom it. A shame as it used to be a better than Tinder but not now."
Brandon Story,"This app is super nice with having very little bots. But if I search for girls only that means only girls not guys and girls. And if i want to look for guys only that means no girls.. Like I don't understand how hard that is.... also after 5 swipes I have to wait 24 hours to use swipes again... I rather be single then pay money for your app that already super glitchty and buggy. Yall are better then tinder, but tinder gives me Like 25 swipes before making me wait, and there only 12 hours..."
lex !,Terrible. Just Like Tinder! THERE IS NOTHING BUT SEXX TOURISTS! Please make a locals only feature.
tylermac111,This app has gone downhill drastically and only seems to want to sell you premium accounts. They've changed the algorithm so you no longer see who liked you in the first few swipes but rather have to reach your daily limit so they can continue pushing premiums on you. This practice is also common with other apps and sites that use bot accounts which bumble also has many of. Go use Hinge instead. Hell even Tinder is better now and Tinder is gross.
Michael Randall,"Beautiful app, travel mode is cool. The quality over the matches surpass Tinder and it is easy to navigate. Thank you. I uninstalled it, now all of a sudden I can't login. I think little people have to much power at this company. Still can't login, 27 Sep 21"
Teh Bro,Did an experiment on this app since I always get a couple likes but never matches. Swiped on everyone for 3 days straight. Never found anyone who liked me. I've been in the same town as well so it's not a location issue. Either bumble has the same issue as tinder with people swiping from far away (ie other countries) or they push back liked people to get you to buy premium. Either way you guys are POS and need to fix your app.
Eddie,The app is way better than tinder. You get the same fake profiles that are shilling their Snapchat or IG handles so they can try to sell you their premium content. Bumble does have a reporting feature for those that is monitored and they actually remove the profiles. My main gripe is that notifications don't work at all on the latest Android update for Pixel 5. I have no idea when someone messages me or I get a match unless I happen to open the app and see it.
DERTH NADER,Better than Tinder by a longshot
nube negra,Horrible app. Only gives the girls 24hrs to reply and force us men to pay if we want to extend the time for them to notice us. It's very misandrist and sexist. It also let's gay men like you even when you say you're straight! So far i haven't been kicked out. But you will get women to far way. Just like in tinder. I'm not paying for this. OKC kick me out for false flags and i don't want the same experience on bumble. The only good thing is you can buy a lifetime sub to be ignored by women
Ins2ne_isaac,"Had the app before I unistalled it, it's rating is lower than tinder at least with bumble they respond to our messages, I am saying please do not become a cash grab company like tinder please Also the women message first is sexist, and I have never had them message me first, y'all need to change thay"
kate wi,"I like it so far with my limited experience. I deleted Tinder after finding this app, it is more detailed has more information about people you see, and you find more normal human beings on here I guess. And a lot of functions are free which is a huge +"
Tulegen Darbassov,"Much better than Tinder so far. However, I'm not sure all users understand first message mechanics. Also, I don't see how advanced filters would be useful for me."
Travis Talistu,Cooler then tinder
Insomniac Hart,"Barely better than tinder. Without money, you aren't meeting anyone. The app goes out of it's way to make any attempt at communication with someone impossible without paying the premium... I spoke to a few women on there, but time ran out and they disappeared. Couldn't reply without paying money... Don't install, this app is sexist against men. The security of men here is non existent... It's all for horrible abusive women. Also, the reply Devs gave me, was and is insulting."
SumahyobbuR Sumah,"Better than Tinder. Girls make 1st move here. So, it gives a very nice feeling to boys. I like it.."
artifex magicae,"Little to no matches (doesn't happen on Tinder or similar apps), constantly trying to get me to buy something. And this ""vaccinated"" badge takes the cringe award home. Good concept for a dating app, worst implementation you can imagine. Made me give up on dating and having physical relationships with friends."
Dr. Swa,"Very bad , suddnly blocked my account stating violation of Rules, I am using Tinder since 3 year but never happened , I if bumble don't want me on board they would have allow me delete my photos who will responsible if mis used"
Nathanael Taylor,"Grindr is a better. Yes, really. I spent a couple weeks on here, and despite being told I had over 40 people who had liked my profile, only matched with three the entire time. So much stuff is locked behind a pay wall. You're better off on Grindr or Tinder."
Lord Lynn,Bumble is great in comparison to Tinder but I think Hinge is even better
Lonaberry,Better than tinder for my needs
Travis H,This is way better than tinder or POF. Way less bots and fake ppl. Just whish u got to have more likes a day
Amit Kumar,"Way better than tinder,TM, etc etc"
Sam Walker,"Love bumble, overall a MUCH better app than Tinder, only wish there was a way to add anthems or specific songs to profiles 😕"
Richelle Limburg,A lot better than Tinder! More enjoyable and a bit more serious than Tinder 😊
Ethical Mindset,"And I thought the clowns on Tinder were dumb. You match, just for the woman to have to engage first, just for the supposed guy to delete message/unmatch. The phuckery is real. I chalk it up to either bots or ego."
A F,Love how the app keeps you matched with one girl that never appears on your swipe feed. Same blurry background when I had a profile from a long time ago. Also arbitrary swipe limits. This app is worse than tinder 0/5 👎
Maurilio Rocha González,"Beware with payment! fraudulent app, I hired Premium for a day, I paid with digital card, next day I received a message with renewal charge, how is it possible if CVV is variable?; at Tinder, with same card an auto renewal, charge doesn't proceed and error message is displayed. Didn't like it, is designed so girls can have a handful of dudes (like if they were in need!), my roomie literally has around 20 guys, so take a seat and wait for your turn. Need trans filter to avoid them showing up."
Rasberry Jam Heaven,Waste of time.. and money. No body chats on here.. worst than tinder
The Pharoah,Bumble is unfortunately just another swipe mini game like Tinder. Seeing who liked you is hidden behind a $30/month pay wall.
Shashi Karkhanis,It's a wonderful app and much better than Tinder. I don't use credit card so unable to use debit card also. Hope the team helps me. Thanks
Utkarsh,Very less swipes per day. I know you are hungry for money but then you can just monetize your app like tinder with in app ads. Other than that your app is the best in terms of UI.
Jake Bowman,"Waste of time. Bumble has you register your number but actually doesn't save it. You can't ""log in"". So if you break your phone or go to use bumble on a different phone, you are unable to access it and it's lost forever. This is another reason why I didn't use it often. Now I don't use it at all! Tinder will always be supreme to bumble."
Mārcis Lielbārdis,"This app gives the feeling that the developers actually care about putting people together. Paywalls are similar to those in tinder, but so far the matches have had a higher-quality feeling. If there's no first message, they get cleaned up. Chat facility is quite good overall."
Mika Clements,"Unable to log into account anymore, no explanation, profile disappeared for matches with no option for refund on boost.👎🏻 NEW EDIT: Still no contact. You guys are criminal. Everyone else, just use tinder. I'll be sure to spread the word of this shady behavior until I'm compensated fairly."
harsh rathod,Worst app ever I'm not getting any matches tinder is better them bumble
Sean Pereyra,"THIS APP IS A SCAM. DO NOT BUY PREMIUM. When no premium is active you get matches and wont match with them untill you purchase premium, but once you have premium you dont ever get matches its like my profile only gets shown to other profiles when there is no premium. Im banned off tinder and this is suppose to be the next best thing but instead i feel as if im getting scammed."
jay C23,"Tl;Dr - great UI UX but app has too many obstacles that holds guys back from its bread and butter - matches. The good: Clean UI UX, and I particularly love the Q prompts which sets up fun convos. The bad: Matches are VERY hard to come by. It's the same in all apps, but Bumble makes it even harder unless you're blessed in the looks department. You have to match and pray the girl deigns to text you FIRST AND do it within 24 hours. Very rarely happens, and so you're better off on CmB or Tinder."
lee layton,"Worst dating app available, fraudulent, if you are not checking in you don't get likes! So your profile just dissappears? It's a joke of an app even ugly people will get likes but not if you are not constantly on it, got to pay to see likes also, just get tinder instead must get on average 20 matches and likes a day easy"
Jamel Gas,"Was using the app for about week then one day I got logged out was unable to log back in, I tried reinstalling the app and using a different device but to no avail, there was no explanation given as to why that happen or how to fix it despite my numerous attempts to contact their team via Facebook messenger and email. I reported this fault more than a week ago and still have not received a reply. I ended up deleting the app and installed Tinder which seems to work better."
Andrew taylor,Way better than Tinder
Ben Monger,"I was told how amazing this app was and sounded so different then apps like Tinder however now signing up to it I can see someone else must be running it now because it's no different from Tinder, if fact by the sounds of comments it's far worse then Tinder"
Daniel Davis,"Worst dating app. You basically have to have a paid subscription to get matches. Women talk first and most match, but don't respond before the match expires (coincidentally, because a paid sub can extend). Had 30 matches I never saw because you have to pay to unlock them. Stick to Tinder, at least you can use it without paying for it."
TB BT,"Most useless app that charges money for no reason. Another horrible app like tinder! Even the business (bizz) section is horrible because it really networks only the telemarketing people or realtors and these networks are free through the internet. Hence, the app provides no value for a paid subscription. Most profiles are dead and like a ghost!"
SAMAR GAMING,fake app like others. dun buy anything. ek bhi match ni milega and agar mil gya to usne ye bolenge ab premium lo.. mostyl fake hai sab.. tinder is much better den dis go for tinder. but tinder ..dun buy this app.report as much as u can guys.
Jordon,"Horrible app. I had my account banned due to linking my Facebook which had my tinder account previously banned so once logging in I was immediately banned for no reason. Funny too cause I was only banned on tinder for telling a girl ""lol that's hypocritical"""
Paul G,"Probably the worst dating app next to tinder, but I've actually met people from tinder. The women first thing is great, but very little actually send a message, and block you when you ask them on a date. And 24 hours for them up message? Get real. On top of it all, anything you purchase is overpriced, but if you don't buy anything your not getting any likes. Remaking your profile puts you back into the loop of people seeing you, so it's being done on purpose by the algorithm."
devanshi srivastava,Better crowd than tinder
Xavi JJ,Good n less biased matching n refers 80% accurate partner in any gender n location mostly suggest unear by n most appreciated suggestions as compared you one's own profile . Happy but wish more options as Tinder or cupid like showing people whom u already right swiped n left swiped but less biased like Tinder stay buzzing n make more matching
Zyzzc Przybylowski,It terrible how u have to pay an app for dating purposes for a one month for 30 dollars just to see like and u have to pay for one day just to see what u got a link from someone. Are you KIDDING ME!!!! ITS OUTRAGEOUS HOW MUCH THERE ASKING. How am I supposed to date someone but can't take them somewhere because I spent most of my money just to see if they liked me this is the worst dating app but has a better profile set up than tinder other than that waste of money.
Lakshay rao,"1. Doesn't let you know how many coins you still have. This led to confusion and buy more. 2. When touched the superswipe option to check if have coins left, they directly deducted €8. 3. Doesn't let you cancel the subscription or(depending on the counrty region) 'Unlink' your card details leading to deduct unwanted subscription charges consecutively. 4. Charges you more than tinder while this platform doesn't have 1/5th of Tinder's userbase. 5. Customer support sucks."
James L,They won't allow a pic of me at the gun range but they allow users to include rhetoric that promotes violence against law enforcement. Bumble is anti police and condones violence against police. Try tinder or match.
Ronan Cullen,"""You are using bumble offline"" Something I am told far too often using this app. Its strange as all of my other apps continue to work normally including tinder and hinge but bumble for as long as I can remember has continues connection issues. I paid once for premium subscription but never again. Youre a huge company now, act like it and ensure you and your app does the bare minimum. Your job."
Kavin Dave,"While i get 3-4 matches every month on Tinder, I haven't gotten a single match here. It's just not worth it"
A Y,I'm giving a 4 so far as I just down loaded the app .. It's so much cleaner the people are alot more real and clean as other apps I've been on everyone on the app were disgusting and rude and judgmental ( tinder so disgusting and rude ) Bummble is more humble :) less stress
TanMAN A,Better than tinder
Tim Schneider,"I bought a month of Boost in a moment of desperation but I didn't get any Spotlights or Superswipes. Tried to contact support 3 times. Got one email back with information I already knew. They stopped responding again when I emailed back. Overall, I find the app slightly better than Tinder (low bar). I like the how you can give extra info in your profile besides your bio. The question prompts are also a nice addition. Beyond that, it's pretty standard fare for a free dating app. Same false hope."
Anton,"I cant upload photo. It just simply does not work. Tried to re-instal app, but did not help. Keep saying ""loading"" and nothing happens. Did not have any problem with uploading photo in tinder. So..."
Brandin Schille,Better and more interactive than tinder
Leon gotget,"This, is not a free app. They give you 2-3 days of swiping, then you hit a ""daily"" swipe limit (which hadn't appeared before despite me being more active the first few days I got the app). waiting a day does nothing if you are in a low population density area like I am. Through some quick research online it seems if you live in a big city it might reset but you will hit you daily limit every 10-15 swipes. Do yourself a favor and download Tinder if you are able."
Varun Kumar,Bumble is on it's way to become trash and useless like tinder
Steve Stasa,I bought lifetime in January (2021) after a few conversations didn't lead anywhere. I haven't had a message since. Same profile on Tinder and Hinge still gets occasional conversations. Really feels like I got scammed.
Prateek Singh,"It could have been better but it's sad that you guys are becoming just another tinder where the girls text first. It used to be so nice when people could use this app with more freedom, sometimes I can only swipe 10 or less than 10 people."
xyz zyx,"Just another scam, tinder's younger brother"
Brandon Petroski,"Genuinely one of the most sexist apps ever made, just because the CEO was getting harassed at Tinder. Overpriced garbage subscription model meant to prey on desperate people."
Darrell Wernsman,"Honestly, highly disappointed. Wish I could get my money back. Nothing even remotely local to me. On top of that you have to really look closely at the profiles, they say your town or city in big letters but right underneath it's a different state entirely. Buying premium does jack all to help meet new people. Limiting the messages to only females being able to message is also a pain. I ran across more fake profiles than Tinder has. I wish I could give it 0 stars and hadn't wasted any time."
Griffin Tuttle,Takes down my pictures and I match with like 2 people in a month. On tinder i match with like 30 people in a week.
Travis Mida,"It's a good app, especially if you compare it to Tinder. There are far less bots here than other apps. I like the fact that women have to message me first when we match. I feel like if I do end up in a relationship, it will probably be because of this app, and not any of the other ones. UPDATE AS OF 9/2/21: I noticed boosts are much more worth their price if you buy them in bulk, and you can use 2 for a total of 150 minutes. Thank you for doing this! ❤️"
Dave Mendoza,This is so app suck so bad because i can't even post photos and i followed the guide lines. Its just so funny that i can post it anywhere else and it won't get taken down. I tried contacting the support team but they send me a msg saying there not reviewing anything. Its so stupid i though it would be better than tinder but apparently not.
Mircea Dolineanu,"Women must initiate conversations. What an interesting twist on the usal dating app setup. But what does every women say to a match? Hi... This is just tinder, but with less features and less people using it."
Luke Eros,"How is this better than Tinder? Way less matches and users in general, a lot of unresolved bugs and the same money model where you have to pay to do anything... In other words - don't waste your time on this"
Rohit Gautam,Worst app ever.. They only want us to spend money.. Never got a single match on bumble... Don't know what is the problem.. Most of the time there are no choices and other dating apps like tinder are way more better than bumble... It seems like bumble is indirectly asking for money to get matches..
Mark Quimbo,"Just like tinder, bumble is different in which woman have to speak to you first if you match. Its a great concept but the app is a freemium dating app. Yes you can keep swiping left or right but I feel like to really meet someone in person, you would need to subscribe. Even with subscription you would still pay for extra things. All about the money for bumble."
Austin Hmmm,"They allow women to do whatever and put up whatever kind of pictures they want, while men have to adhere to strict guidelines. It's sexist and toxic. Just get tinder."
Knella,"Es buena y parece ser confiable, lo malo es que se nota que es dificil que aparezcas a varias personas y bueno la verdad la considero mejor que tinder"
June Piper-Brandon,Just a step above Tinder.
AfternoonLemon,Message notifications need some work (same as Tinder!) but otherwise good app!
Bradley,"I once described it as a ""Wal-Mart Tinder"" but I kept trying. I am still not impressed. Good idea? Yes, but unfortunately you lose a lot of matches because for one reason or another a woman just doesn't message first. Why is anybody's guess, nerves, lack of interest, accidental right swipe, forgot to check the app, etc. The algorithm needs some work. If I filter out women with kids I get 3-5 swipes but as soon as I turn that off there are exponentially more women with no kids. Figure that out."
Aaryan,Great app guys. Bumble > Tinder
aditya mish,"The spotlight and boost features are a joke.. just money making strategies, hardly getting the matches. Tinder is much better in this case, atleast you get matches while boosting. Save your time and talk to a girl in the pub instead, higher probability to date that way."
Aygun Doruk,"This app is even worse than the money grabbing Tinder. Go for Happn, that dating app is better."
Foodie,Way better then tinder I feel that yes women don't want to make the first move. Yet at least you know when they do that they are actually interested. Plus it breaks the cycle that men have to make the move and gives more control to women. All for it.
Umang Jha,"It has all the best features of tinder and whatever it lacks, the best dating app. Would recommend."
Madison Hartz,Better than tinder
Roberto Alfonso Mendoza Rodríguez,Much better than tinder!
Michael Rotelli,"Absolute garbage. In the same time while using Tinder, Hinge, CMB and OkC, I had likes, matches and conversations with unique, real users on all of them. On Bumble I had no matches or even any likes. I'm not *that* ugly."
Gabriela S.,So much better than Tinder
Nicholas Rodriguez,Trash just like Tinder
David Kairu,Tinder is the ghetto.. love Bumble
Maitreyi Dhar,"Overall Worst App. Tinder is better than this as you can't see who like you until you pay for premium. Basically, you can't use this app unless you pay for the premium."
David Ruffolo,"Just as bad as tinder, if not worse"
Nastya Remele,"70% of users are farther from me than 3000km. Besides once I discovered I was blocked because someone complained my account was fake. My account wasn't fake but there's no ""connect with us"" button. Besides this app is so not working I lose nothing using other apps only, like tinder and Badoo"
Steve H,Better people than Tinder
Soly Reddy,"24 hour wait vs tinder 12 hour wait when ya run out of swipes , yes you can pay but they both free , and a 24 hour wait is to long but other then that its a dating app"
Syed Ali Hassan,"Never had a match, useless like tinder"
Thomas Ferreira,"Not a ""pay-to-win"" like tinder has become tho more expensive. The 24 hour and disappear makes it nice and forces one to really decide if they want to talk"
Ashutosh Pandey,"Have been using for 6 months now, not a single match yet. Free version is of no use. On Tinder atleast you get matches even on free version."
Nebula,Trash literally forced charged me randomly. Back to tinder
Michael E Dowling,Utterly useless. Apparently I swiped through all the women within a 122km radius of me in about 30 minutes and now there's just nobody left. I live next to a big city. Just use tinder like everyone else until bumble fixes their app
kania rifianti,"After i installed this app, a day after i got my account blocked out of no reason, i just found out that this app is on the same platform as badoo which blocked me because a guy reported me as I DIDNT LET HIM COME TO MY APARTMENT! Dating apps should be fun and trustworthy, not one-sided judgement! I found this app is so unprofessional, UNLIKE TINDER."
Lance,Roughly 2 years ago I installed Bumble. After a couple days I got my first match. Here we are now engaged and planning a wedding for next fall. All in all I had a much more success vs Tinder
Mr Nickwan,"Terrible concept and terrible application of that concept. The whole point of the app is that women message first but they never do. I never have an issue starting conversations, keeping them going or even the women messaging first on other dating apps. The app also routinely tries to make you purchase premium by matching you with people outside of your requirements. Honestly just download Tinder or Hinge."
Chris Summers,"Can't believe anything can be worse than Tinder but here it is, Bumble! Almost no activity from women. It's quite barren for dating, in NZ. Most of the ladies use Tinder instead Response to Dev comment: Yes I have, I've tried everything, including ""spotlight"". Same results, or lack thereof!"
Eric Bervid,Suckss just as bad as tinder
Sage Skylight,"With other apps like Tinder, Badoo or even Grindr and SeekingArrangement in the dating game, one would think that certain features would come free of charge but this app tries to get our money as if ""finding love"" had a price or as if the app begged for it, which is very displeasing; if these features continue as they are i'll soon do as my friends and just erase the app for the unnecessary annoyance... stick to the other ones."
robert mcmillan,Better than tinder lol
Tim Beck,"Lame app. Even when paying for premium, I got hardly any matches - unlike Tinder - and far fewer messages. Most of the profiles I perused were from other locations, but the app shows profiles based on physical location of a device despite the user listing their living location. Unless deliberately using travel mode, profiles that are displayed should default to where the users physically live. If I set my distance limit to 50 miles, I have no interest in users across the country."
Rustam S,Overall.. it's better than most dating apps but some of the features are quite restricted. Besides..it should market itself else Tinder still gets the chunk of the population. I mean that. More freedom on the change of name and search filters could do without a subscription. Seriously.
Nomad Seljset,"Ive been on this app for 7 months and never matched once with anyone, not a single woman I think they block ppl matching if you don't pay Too bad the women on here seem really nice i only meet bad women on tinder but atleast i constantly match with other apps"
Emanuel Falade,"Full of catfish, at least Tinder has confirmation."
Br B,"The problem with bumble is you match with a lot if fat unattractive women who can't get matches on tinder and god forbid you speak to them like the last call in a bar, you'll be banned from the app regardless of if you paid for a subscription or not."
Daniel,"Basically unusable without premium. Also pretty sure you guys deleted my last review. Nice one. A few years ago was pretty much seen as the app to rescue us all from Tinder, but now it is way more restrictive than Tinder. Ironic"
kaelob wray,Pretty good app tbh better than tinder
Ufos Nexus 4,"Better than tinder, that's for sure. Premium prices are outrageous."
Michael Stallings,"New review. Tinder is better. Atleast on tinder u only wait 12 hrs to match more people instead of waiting over 24 hrs. Plus if a girl marches u afyer u swiped them days before, u don't have to wait for them to write you, only for them to not text u fast enough and lose the match. Not everyone wants to text multiple people at once. NOT GOING TO BLOW YOUR SM UP FOR YOU. THIS APP SUCKS. TINDER SUCKS TOO BUT ATLEAST ITS BETTER."
Taylor Vernon,"Cute app that operates similarly to Tinder. Difference is that you are not only locked into dating. You can specify that you're using it for friends (Bumble BFF) or for networking as well. I personally intend to use it for networking once I'm halfway finishing with school. I would recommend it to anyone looking to date, find some friends if they're new to an area, or wanting to expand their network."
Adi nz,real hard to remove the suspension(cancel the payment). they don't have that option on the Bumble app! (Tinder has it) that feel like this company behave like a Mafia (criminals). Also they use algorithm to block reduce the numbers of girls around u. u will see maybe 10% of the all number of girls!
Kevin Vieira,Werid got blocked on a app when I barely use and barely get matches so I don't understand how I got blocked from an app I don't even use . Anyways back to tinder
Kingfarathor,You need the option to block people by phone numbers on here I found my ex wife on here and some of her friends please fix this issue and add the fixture that Tinder has and other dating apps have. Also need to add a hobbies and interests filters. I'm looking for a game nerd in my area that doesn't have kids and is very outgoing. Please also fix and add this. Your app filters are restricting only limiting to 2 filter options this is ridiculous.
Andrew Ellis,"Compared to Tinder, Bumble feels good to use as far as user experience goes. I honestly love it, but since it's a dating app, I have to deduct a point."
John Estrada,"Genuine review here. I have Bumble, Tinder and Hinge. Out of all three, Bumble is by far the worst. I very rarely get matched with someone. I'll usually match with someone almost daily with Tinder. Hinge is by far the best because I do match with someone if not multiple people daily. My profile pictures and descriptions and virtually the same across all three platforms. I give two stars because I HAVE matched with people but maybe only once a month.."
C.A. Milson,"Can't exactly see how this is different to any other ""dating"" site or app. ""women respond first"" concept is not a game-changer, nor is it any different to Tinder, POF or any one of the thousands of dating apps/websites that there is on the market. As Bumble states ""On Bumble, women always make the first move. If she doesn't initiate a conversation within 24 hours, the connection expires"" ""If a man swipes right on a person he is interested in, she also has to do the same"". How is that different than the rest of the dating apps? It is not. ""Women have to make the first move"" has been around since the dawn of dating agencies. If you really want something that is a ""real"" game changer, how about where women do actually make the first move and swiping right, instead of the men having to waste their time by doing the chasing for zero interest."
Rifqy F,better than tinder. period.
Ht Lufc,I like the idea that women can only message first. You've just got to have patience. I think it's better than pof and tinder
Shan Qureshi,My experience with bumble is really bad as you won't get much matches here as tinder and I think they show your profile to very few people which really sucks..
jarrod mcgahan,"Superior to tinder in almost every way. Tinder will give you matches right when you install or reinstall (after a long period of absence), then in order to try to persuade you to promote yourself, they secretly limit matches. I get 2-3 matches a day on bumble, while it has been over a week in tinder since my last match. That's real guys. Gj bumble for NOT using monetization tactics that are underhanded like tinder."
Devon Smith,"Used to be a pretty decent app, after reinstalling it a year later it's completely monitized now. Even tinder doesn't have swipe limits."
Andrew Hastie,I emailed bumble support to get my subscription restored after it disappeared. Never received a response back after multiple inquiries. Don't waste your time or money on this app. Stick with Tinder.
Jacob Dickey,"This app is getting to be on the same level as Tinder, which is pretty sad."
Edward O'Neil,I have much better conversations than on Tinder. Women self-select so I'm not wasting time messaging women who aren't interested.
Roger,"It's a money trap flat out. Matches are nil and have a set time before they expire. Honestly use tinder, way more people and you matches don't time out. Also bear in mind bumble got into some trouble for charging credit cards and had a class action suit against them."
Nicola Mihaita,"This app puts matches first, and encourages you to chat, its well thought, and a lot better than tinder. It should be 5 stars not 3. I like what they did with the chat that expire in 24h if you don't reply. I am a developer also and I think that this app is genious."
kudos,"No customer service at all. Why is there no automated system to get your account back like Tinder. Instead have to speak to ""someone"" on Twitter or FB which I don't have. Why doesn't it use the registered email that opened the account. No doubt they will reply to this and say contact Bumble on their email (which they don't reply) or will send Twitter or Facebook link...... Painful"
Swati Dhawan,Bumble should really review their strategy..Limiting the number of profiles is only limiting their popularity....No other app does that....Mostly people prefer Bumble because there are genuine profiles and weeds out all unwanted profiles...They have the advantage over Tinder where its has really got weird and i think out of hands from Tinder team that you see so many bot profies r couples coming up for threesomes only because its easy to make profile.So Bumble should look into this gap.
Shawn Walton,"While the selection of Instagram models from California or New York is excellent, geographic location and zip seems second/third andinstead replaced by highest rated Instagram models based on preforance of gender. (unless you pay the tax of membership) witch maybe worthwhile if 90% of feeds both male and female weren't filled with bots (for females I'm sorry but dick pics are the remainder just like pof or tinder) there might be something here but it seems like there is no quality control."
Joe Fox,"Can be an easy breezy matching app, or you can write a longer profile. Compared to Tinder, it was better for finding people who wanted to meet."
Tom Smith,Terrible compared to Tinder which is a shame cause the girls on Bumble seem to be more serious about dating. There's no rewind button which sucks cause I always accidentally hit X instead of ✔ and they drip feed you matches to keep you paying. Hinge and Tinder are way better.
Nick hurd,"It's just like tinder. I mean, what the f@*% is the point of a dating app if you can't see who likes you. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. I thought the whole purpose was to find people, and let people find you, and if you like each other you get together. That's kind of difficult to do if you can't see the people who like you without a subscription. Super lame and I'm deleting my profile today"
Sanman Chavan,Better than tinder
Justin Stothers,Serves it's purpose and not overly expensive if you do decide to upgrade unlike tinder. Tinder is stupid expensive and no I'm not being paid to say that. I refuse to spend money on that app.
Duston Smith,"Should we call Bumble, baby Tinder now?! Bunch of likes but never seem to get a match. Now they up their minimum price to $14 just so you can see who liked you. Use to like Bumble, not anymore."
Sebinsol,"When there are pay walls blocking key features, that's one thing but they legitimately block you from even matching completely unless you pay up. It SAYS ""done for today"" but it has been 3 days since it blocked me from matching so I uninstalled. Don't waste your time, many make profiles are for validation or scams so even though other apps like POF and Tinder are also wastes of time, they at least let you use the app"
Emmanuel Giyani,It's better than Tinder
Will Vander Heide,"How is this app rated number 1? Been on here for months, not a single connection because of the 24 hour time limit on starting a conversation that only one party is allowed to start - even with a time extension on every possible match. Have had waaaaaay better luck on OKCupid, Hinge, even Tinder. Eliminate the time limit and I would definitely edit this rating."
Dusk Moonblade,"Going by reviews read, this is a shittier app then Tinder, and Tinder is nothing but a bot fest."
Ranodip Raj Baidya,Definitely better than tinder
Mephirez,"I cannot believe they jacked the price of premium up so high. You can purchase a FULL MONTH of Tinder platinum (Tinder's top of the top subscription) for cheaper than you can buy a single week of Bumble premium. On top of that, the app no longer even puts people that have swiped right on me into my feed, when it used to do so regularly. Absolute waste of time."
Casey Z,"I'm female and prefer Tinder over this. This software is slower and has a few technical glitches. Making women text first is a giant mistake and pointless (if contact is only possible when both ppl swipe yes). User base is way smaller. The quality of ppl is not superior on this app. Same as Tinder, men are on here trying to use u for a ONS. (The difference being, on bumble they try to sound politically correct about it and waste more of ur time.)"
Herokiller h8,It's an app designed by racists that makes sure people of color aren't shown as often as white people. Tinder and Hinge are much better.
Matthew Brian Homewood,"Constantly saying ""you're using Bumble offline"", absolute joke considering I have a fine internet connection. Worse than Tinder."
Abhishek Bishnoi,The app algo is working such that it gives pictures of pretty ladies first to lure you to buy membership but you don't really get matches here ( 1 per month & that too rarely) .I found Tinder better. I have bought membership mutliple times but all went waste
Zachary Binks,Better than tinder.
James Bond 007,Had the app for a month and I got drunk and paid for premium for a week and honestly after realizing what I done thought it was cool but its kinda expensive and also I have had better luck on tinder I hate to say it more people and also ive had bumble crash on me alot... not a bad app just not really worth the money
Vinay Krishna ꪜ,"It is a fake app , tinder has refund policy but bumble is non refundable.Bumble is a silly scamming app lost my money but i learnt my lesson.Would give it 0 star but i can't. (Bumble team your reply is the worst lol )"
garlicbread,"Just like the rest. nothing special. glitchy, stupid. A new development over the last few days, I now get three (3) swipes PER DAY. THREE. 1, 2, 3 SWIPES A DAY. completely and utterly abhorrent app, at this point I'd rather use tinder and that is saying something."
PAMA AN ACE COMPANY,"No technical glitch in the app, But I feel tinder primium is better then paying for bumble,"
Rose A,"Used to be really good, you got a free filter so you could really narrow it down, and you could go back if you accidentally swiped left on someone 3x a day for free. Both of these are now gone and it's basically tinder but where the woman has to start the conversation.... No thanks"
Rob dob slob,Just like tinder only worse
Omar Sobh,Tinder auf wish bestellt. Die Idee finde ich cool. Die App aber leider nicht.
M90 A.,"This is more expensive than tinder & you rarely get matches without boosting your profile. And compared tinder, you'll have to wait twice as long when you run out of swipes."
K. Lied,Everything is behind a paywall. Didnt this app get its start because tinder started to charge?
Will perrot,One of the worst of the dating apps. You only have 24 hours to respond. If you make a mistake swiping the match is gone. At least Tinder gives you one super like a day.
Toni toni,For me this app can compete with tinder. You can see only genuine real people and no scammers. Like the option where ladies have to message first.
Rolando Mota,Apparently just another tinder. Poor app and customer support. Everything works however when you give them your money
Daniel Shalome,"Better than hinge. Few matches in the first few months. Maybe had more if i opted for paid subscriptions.. nevertheless not a fit app for Chennai, India. This app has been lying idle for months. Had more activity on Tinder. Do love the interface and option with modes. Definitely not workin out for the locality maybe it does for countries abroad. Uninstalling after a year of using this with no online results here. (I had few 3-5 matches blurred)"
Archit jain,One of the best app than tinder which has good options with good people. Easy to use and best user interface
Ramesh Suthar,Better then tinder 😪
andrew white,"Kinda like tinder you have a limited amount of likes before you run out. But then it never reset. I've been out of right swipes for 3 days now. Says I'll get more tomorrow but then tomorrow comes and it's still the same message. Edit Gave it another try, now it's suggesting men when it's set to women"
Marina Luz,"Good, only things are that you have to pay to add more than 3 filters to your search and have endless swipes which on tinder are free or at least you get a lot more free swipes."
Alexandru Stane,"Worse than tinder, if that is even possible"
Chee Music,After the first initial day swipe cost money. Tinder is better..because its free
BAX 1,"Great Soo far. For a guy my age, Soo much better than Tinder"
Razvan Florentin Popescu,meh. the usual progressive . woke app. missing carnivore . having vegan. promoting globalist agenda more or less. somewhat functional. superior to tinder
Dylan Southard,"Probably the worst money grab dating app I've ever seen. The prices are ridiculously stupid, they show you fake profiles just to get your attention, says you have people in your Beeline to match with but never see them. Tinder blows this trash app out of the water. The lady who owns it just wants money."
Daniel Andrews,I loved this app so much its better then tinder and grindr its very much safe and i met a lot of good ppl for friendship and all even the cost for membership or other kind of things are low of cost not like tinder its too costly
Charles T,Decent app until the new update that got rid off the one day upgrade. now they are forcing 1 week. for that amount then your better off paying a little extra and going to zoom or tinder. ugh tinder I know still bumble seems that they are getting greedy.
Chris H,"They make the app suck on purpose so that you feel more inclined to pay them money. dont download this app, Tinder, or Hinge. All useless wastes of time"
Humoyun Koraboev,Better than tinder. Period.
Robert Clarke,Becoming more like Tinder everyday.
B C,"The time limit on sending messages after a match is stupid (I'm gay so as a guy in that context can say hi first). By the time I see a match (because I never see it straight away, I'm busy with other things too), I either have to risk looking desparate by saying hello late at night, early in the morning before work or during working hours - or try to remember it's there and respond to it in the short gap between finishing work and the time the match is due to expire. I'll stick to Tinder then."
Nomad,I'm not gonna rate it low just because I don't get matches. There are limited daily swipes unlike Tinder. You can't see likes. Otherwise it's okay. 5/5 because it doesn't have ads like Badoo. Why is that a thing?
Atwi Musa,"always lose my account for no reason or for just one report. It is super bad you have always to start again and do an account with new phone number. Tinder is much better. Plus priority for girls, no human rights no equal chances."
Andrew Train,"Sadly they only seem to care about how much they can charge you these days. Used to be a great little app, some free services, very reasonably priced upgrades (which they've now removed) but it's got just as bad as tinder with the excessive charges and how they've split services to charge you even more. Very disappointing 😞"
Amit Kumar,"Worst experience ever. Bought premium for 2 months and seems like it doesn't work at all. Travel mode seems to show you other people's profiles but it doesn't show them your profile. At last I would say, if you're to spend money then Tinder is way better!"
Gabriel Zárate,"I've been using this app and paid for the lifetime membership for the better part of a month. The big three apps in my area are Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, so naturally I got myself setup in all three to cast the biggest net possible. Of the three, this is by far the worst since there are almost no matches. Waste of money and time that you could be spending on dates or other services. Maybe I'm just unlucky, but I haven't had any issues getting matches or holding a conversation on the other apps.."
Jen K,"Bumble used to be my favorite dating app ever. So much better than Tinder; however, I was banned for being underage? I've contacted the support team twice now and never received an answer. I'd be willing to pay premium if I had the app or someone would get back to me on my issues. To make it clear I've been over 18 for almost 2 years now and still cannot be unbanned! ugh!!"
Sykirian,This app is trash just like Tinder. Don't bother
Andrew Dennis Michalak c,"Better than Tinder, in my opinion. Real people, real meetups."
U K,Better than Tinder. Not a lot of fake profiles it seems.
Keshav Bagaria,Better than tinder for sure
Mr.E,Never loads anything. I e deleted and reinstalled. Updated and still just loads two or three people then nothing.. or I'll get to the end of my free swipes and it will stay like that for days.. get tinder it's much better
kumar prabhakar,Wasteof time ! Like wise tinder. Nvr ever subscribe. Ull b wasting money .
Kelly H,This isn't a good app for women. Great ego boost for guys though. Also be prepared to swipe left a lot - no difference in Tinder when it comes to quality of matches after the 1st day.
Eren Uluer,"What a scam, someone this makes tinder look so much better. The waiting period for me takes like more than 24 hours. There's more ads then any promise in matches. I see no hope in this app."
Aaron Lutz,"You only get matches if you pay for the app, they don't let you get them for free just like tinder and hinge. They also keep deleting my review for calling them out."
Adam Kinsey,Compared to tinder and hinge the number of matches is significantly lower.
Aaron Wickware,"I think this app is definitely better than tinder, there is just more option to define yourself. I also think it's important to separate the people who want relationships and people are looking for friendships. The only reason I dont give it a 5 is because you have to wait 24 hours to swipe if you run out and that dumb."
Sleekorange,"Its a pretty good app, unlike tinder I actually went out and met so e of these people. And even went out on a few dates, so this app is definitely better than tinder. They could add short gifs or short videos to bios."
Andrei Ivanov,Tinder but worse
Taylor,"at least bumble doesn't ban you for no reason like tinder does!! I do appreciate the premium features, but they're outrageously expensive. tinder's premium was $15/month. bumbles is double. bumble also isn't as active as tinder & im only getting about 3 matches a day that actually respond."
FLAMEGAYZER,Your account gets blocked for no reason this app is the same as tinder and badoo you get banned for no reason. Quit sad how people report you because you reject them
Raunak Sharma,"Even worse then tinder, if I give tinder 1 star I'll give you .25"
Reeze The Vampire,"This app is like tinder but less buggy and with a much nicer UI. The probelm it suffers is the same as tinder, though; matches almost never happen. To make matters worse the 24 hour match timer is a mess. I got 5 matches and lost 4 to the timer even after the extension. The last person I matched never responded. I'm sure if dating apps work for you this will too. I doubt you will get anything new here."
Justin West,"Went looking for love.... found debt, this maybe the worst thing since tinder."
Paul,I got bumble because it seemed more serious than tinder. I've met this woman there who shared similar values and interests. Forward a yeah and a half later and now she is my wife! Just be patient and the right person will come to you. This app got me from slight depression to being the happiest and married! My whole life has changed. Do thank you to bumble for this.
storm trooper,"It's usually at the Highest limit, it's easier (especially with tinder, the only one that actually works) to keep swiping and getting the matches without having to pay anything. So that's not the issue, it's literally hiding them away, I suspect to make you frustrated and wanna buy the thing. I don't agree with that, as a dude, I'll probably be paying for everything anyways if a woman does somehow want to give me a go, so to have to pay a lot of money just to find potential dates, it's dumb"
Francis Emmett,I dont want to share my location with hundreds of complete stranger. I just want to talk to one person. let me chat without turning on my location. also stop trying to be Tinder. swiping is dumb. just show us who's avalible and give us better filters.
Jamie Lives,I like how women make the first move. It seems like a classier crowd than tinder
Kyle Frank,Even tinder allows more likes for the free version. 10 likes in a day shouldn't lock someone out.
Sharky White,"Better than Tinder. More information, easier to access."
Pavel Rykov,"No better than Tinder. Bunch of fake profiles and, worse, fake girls. No one here is looking for any genuine or real connections. Don't waste your time, cause the girls on here definitely will do it for you."
Brayla Cornwell,"I made account with them yesterday, after 2 hours of having it i try to log back on it and it said my account was banned when I havent even talked to anyone yet! And I only had 3 matches at the time. Makes no sense will never recommand them to anyone. Still with tinder you guys. Bumble is wack!! Obviously y'all don't investigate at all because I haven't even message anyone on there before y'all Banned me so it makes no sense. You must didnt like what I wrote in my bio. Smh."
douglas snader,"I think i was punished for my bad review, after waiting over 30 hours i was given 8 people to swipe on before ""come back tomorrow"" little secret that is 24 hours. I only been here for 2 days so it isnt like a lack of options 😆 probably leaving this app soon but i will kick it for some days just to see if this is the trend or not. *update* about 5 more swipes but I get notifications that I am cool to swipe. But then no. Still better than OKC or Tinder..."
Sóley Sigfúsdóttir,"the lengthy profiles make u take in their personality a lot more than say, tinder. forces u to scroll thru the whole thing to see all their pics. great idea i love it lol"
sheila fitzgerald,Tinder treats women with more respect. I did contact support and never got a reply. My rating stands I wrote you on 6/19/21 how long should one wait for a reply.
Nerul Vrudahi'r,"Worst app, keeps listening on trolls that report my profile coz I look younger than my age. Wasted my premium on this. I hope they get a better mod or a better bot for these kind of things. Tinder is way better. This app could've exceeded them but they're too strict and dumb to even realize what the heck they were doing. This app is scam."
Royce James-goodman,"Decent app, better than tinder."
Sam Din,"About the same quality as Tinder, pure garbage."
Aayush Singh,Well had better exp than tinder..
Maxi's World,Horrible dating app. Better off with Tinder
Marius Fechete,"First day i was swiped YES 3 times, got premium - all out of area, never spoke, 2 weeks later never got swiped YES again. Just a little scam to get my money. Also chatting starts when the girl messages you, i just wonder how many don't know that and just sit there waiting for a message - the matches dissappear in 24 hours btw. This is just a tinder with a different colour."
Craig Lyons,"Deliberately refuses to give you the chance to swipe on the people who have liked you in a cynical attempt to extract money. Like tinder, if tinders whole hook was based on something that all available evidence shows almost never happens"
Meii,"Terrible, pls don't download this app, wasting money n time,, I prefer tinder sorry to say"
Dan Miclovan,Pay to Match !!! Stay away ! On free apps Tinder or OKcupid i get matches every day for free and here not one in 1 year. Woke app that confirms the saying: Go woke and go broke!
jayson king,"Premium one day purchase no longer available, which was about the only edge this app had over tinder. Now. . Its just as money grabbing... avoid."
Ben,"The one girl I match with was in the Philippines and wasn't actually a girl, this app is full of bots, tinder might be a thirst trap but it's more reliable than this, makes you pay for anything that might help you get a match but otherwise it's a waste of time"
Andy Stevenson,Something wrong here. Very few likes despite paying all their fees. I switched to (free) Tinder with the same photos and the likes rolled in. Could be different clientele but given previous reviews below I'm inclined to think otherwise.
James Wood,"Bumble could be good, however it has 2 fatal flaws. One of the flaws hurts the disabled community with its use of filters, especially the height filter. Filters should not be a thing. They alienate users. The other big issue is the timer. I would like to know why they have a timer when all it does is create frustration. They have a section about don't be frustrated about it, yet it's the apps fault for having a pointless timer. Until then tinder is a better option."
Liz Beaver,"Made a joke about needing a sugar daddy because I blew my stock portfolio on GME. Not sure how this was taken seriously in any context as it's a pretty well known meme but I'm guessing Bumbles NLP or whatever they're using for policy enforcement picked up on ""sugar daddy"" or I got reported by salty morons. Either way, not a good place to find someone. Tinder has way more critical mass still. Will happily use a different app that has a sense of humor."
ronit das,Kay bekar app hay aye. Match hie nehi hota.. Isse to tinder accha hay kamse kam match to hota hay... Kitne din hogaye.. Account open kiye hay.. Ahapar.. Match his nehi hota.. 😩😩
Dushyant Jain,"Experience was good but these dating should deativate the all funtionless accounts after certain period of time. This might reduce the fake accounts. ""Seriously fake account was the reason I left tinder"""
Jacob singer,No way to get back on to premium membership if you restart account. Tinder has a reference number.
js1112111,"More class than tinder but half the profiles are fakes, instagram models or sc girls."
Joshua Garcia,Worst dating app ever even makes tinder yes tinder look better. My account gets blocked because some girl told she wanted to have relations with me but im okay bumble I'll get my revenge on y'all soon
Jack Pedicel,"Not bad but the app makes me question my sanity. I've had 3 matches that never responded, do people know that women have to respond first? One of the weirdest differences between tinder that seems to only make it harder to actually talk with women if you're a man."
David Hocevar,Bubble is unabashedly anti men. Now I'm gunna get a paid subscription to Tinder!
Jacob Funnell,For whatever reason this has been the very worst of both Tinder and Hinge for me.
Mrunal,"Very nice app ,easy to use I found it better than tinder"
Andrew McCartney,"Good app so far, I prefer it to Tinder."
Hannah Picklesimer,Honestly this app is sooo good and better than tinder. Idk why the reviews aren't better. Making a profile is a lot more in depth and detailed. The match making process is a bit better. Haven't even tried the friends/bizz part but I'm sure they're great too
Eric Parsons,"I rarely ever get matches on this app, better luck on tinder, but the quality of women is much higher on this app. Seems to be more for relationships, than casual dating. I like that. Keep it up. Get more people on board."
Howard Horowitz,Great much better than tinder.
Henry Seddon Jnr,Does the job. Miles better than Tinder!
Siddhartha Wankhade,Way better than Tinder...
Glenn Bendixon,"Easy to use and fast interface. Scrolling through a bio to see pictures, not flipping through a gallery, really makes me want to read more and get to know people better. It feels less shallow than Tinder, but lots of people still seem to use it."
Jack Countryman,"I haven't been using it for long (couple days) but it's been solid, different format than tinder but I like it too. *Pros over tinder (in my opinion) : - you can use more filters than you can on tinder (find certain desired personalities) - you can fill out a much, much more detailed bio (good for gauging people and convos) -filters are so good *Cons over tinder -it limits the amount of swipes you get over the course of a day -The females have to text first, I like opening up w my own lines"
get to de chapa,Its no tinder but it gets the job done at the end of the day
Joseph Mitchell,Total baitware/ransomware scam. Do not be sucker and pay for this scam. This software baits you with notifcations of a potential match and pay to see who likes you. I havent paid but every time I still matched them they ghost or instantly unmatch total scam. Tinder gets results this is total waste of time.
Nikhil Chauhan,I have right swiped entire Indian girls on bumble but no match I have already purchased boots subscription guys I don't feel anyone should use if same happens with them. Atleast tinder gives matches though they don't talk or they are 🤖.look into the issue developer my X is a tester so can't blame them 😂
LuckyMike,"There's less wasted motion on bumble than most other dating apps--women initiate conversations, so it forces them to move on their interest from the start. Bumble has better options for men, in my experience too. It's not a fix-all dating site, but I notice better quality here than Tinder."
Chris Tselepi,"It's the best dating app in Sydney (Tinder is bogus hack and OKC is not what it used to be) but the Bumble problem is no message from matches, even when you extend it 24hrs... It's a ridiculous system. My ex used this app and said she had so many matches that she barely replies to any of them before it expires. People get busy, it's understandable that matches need more time to respond. I'd love to see a 7 day expiry timeframe, then you know that no message is likely that they're not interested"
Lauren Castle,Out of all dating apps..I feel like this one is the best for serious relationships and connections. Only ever tried this and Tinder though so 💁‍♀️
Jay Alexander,"Great app, meet more people in person then tinder tbh"
Brett Farber,I just can't really find anything about bumble that's better than tinder. Both are basically toxic for young adults.
Satish Bangera,"You know why tinder is more famous and more downloaded app than ? It's because when a lady matches a guy, they can chat with each other, which is not the case with your app..... change the approach before people change you !!!"
Neelay Doshi,Much better than tinder.
Malhar __,"Really helps you find your specific type, definitely better than tinder❤️"
Guy G,Just a worse version of Tinder. Less people and about 5 times the price for premium features. People use Bumble when they give up on Tinder and OKC or because of their woke marketing campaigns. Thats all.
Raven Slater,customer service is terrible and it's just tinder with extra steps
Liviu Lmu,"lol this is worst than tinder, it ask for money on every step and they don't give a damn about you"
joseph patrick,It's great I like it better than tinder
Sam Trm,"A politically correct Tinder. Just another dumpster of sexually frustrated men. The quota for new swipes doesn't renew after the first day. The ""contact us"" doesn't work."
Dan Bows,Trashy tinder where only women can message first. Very censorious as well. No pics with guns or dead animals is stupid even tho it doesnt affect me
Mugeoun,"This isn't necessarily the apps fault, but I'm giving up. I've matched with a lot of guys and all of them unmatch right after I say something, if they haven't before I did; no matter what I say. Men want women to message first so bad but then never reply or unmatch you when you make your move. I'm tired of being unmatched constantly and I've deleted my account. Guess I'll just go back to tinder."
Neal Howard,Great dating ap. Not the spam Tinder has
mrminiature11,I'd give it a 5 star if it wasn't priced so badly. If the prices were more inline with Tinder this would be easily the best dating app and I'd happily pay for those extra features.
A Google user,great app hope I can find a date. very addictive and way better then tinder I would recommend it to any one that's single
Aiden G,This app is far better than most dating apps. As long as you have patience. I paid for the subscription which unlike other dating apps doesn't scam you. The ability for women to message first creates this environment that's less creepy than an app like Tinder. If you live in an area with a lot of people this app is great. I do wish that you could view all the profiles of the people you swiped left on. It's a small issue but it's one that I noticed.
Alienistic Oddities,10/10 for Bumble :3 It's like Tinder but without all the bullying and less people looking for hookups. It's a genuinely good app for finding platonic friends too - which is hard in this day and age.
Ali E,Horrible app. A tinder copycat but sexist and anti-male. Just imagine if there was an app where males would only be given preference and control.
Rorik Goerhart,Better than tinder and those apps but makes me wait 2 to 3 days before letting me swipe again.
Aaron Tremblay,"My feelings for this app. are mostly negative. This tinder clone which appeared to have a friendlier interface had left me with nothing but low self esteem. Either I'm the ugliest person in the world or this app just throttles your visibility to other users unless you use the paid services. I believe I've had Bumble for over a month now, and after swiping frequently in the evening around 'prime time' as advised, I havnt received a single like in the menu that tries to bait in into paying money."
Nora Holder,"Bumble is quite clearly lgbt friendly. I had to email tinder & bumble to change my deadname; bumble removed it within an hour, tinder banned me without reason after the request. thanks"
Hyperion ZII,The app sucks. You never match with any of the likes that will be unveiled for a price. Had 11 likes all month no match.boring as whale balls fellas. My profile is fine..doing awesome on tinder .thanks anyway for the offer of help with my profile haha .I had 20 matches in my first few hours on tinder and still going .I had 5 in 1 month on bumble. It's a ghost town. I have read the other reviews and agree 100%. Bumble is a waste of time. I'm not stupid I know how the app works
Mystery Meat,Doesn't feel as annoying as tinder with the fake accounts but they only let you swipe a few times every three days and want big$$ to do just about anything.
Zac Crist,"Horrible, got banned from this app, and Tinder. Too many people get offended these days."
Jasmine Bowser,Only here because I got banned on tinder for threatning people
Alex N,"Bunch of fake profiles, might as well call it Tinder now. And nobody with integrity likes tinder... Edit: still fake. Also they won't let me sign in anymore,.never verifies my phone number when I put the code in. Weird!"
Kayla,"I found my partner after messaging him on this app. Compared to Tinder, Bumble connections feel more real and personalized. There's a great batch of different types of people to swipe on and even befriend or date. My only complaint was the swipe limits. Tinder can go on endlessly, meanwhile Bumble is very limited without premium. It's up to the user if it's worth the cost for a subscription."
pervy sage,Dont know who threw a wrench in your machine but your app doesnt work anymore. I can literally swipe right once a day before the whole thing breaks down. This app makes tinder look good and thats saying something
D. W,"Compared to other dating apps I've used this is by far the best one, BUT it's too freaking expensive, honestly if you keep the price similar or less than Tinder i can guarantee you'd have many subscribers."
Gaurav Meena,This app sucks. Don't even try to buy spotlight or premium.. its worthless. Go for tinder.
Josh Rocks,better than tinder ig
Chiluvuri Jethandra varma,I used both tinder and bumble. I feel bumble was good.
Jc Finch,"Definitely better than tinder, more reliable girls use this app!"
Thomas Sureau,"The app has been hacked. Do not use the IN feature that opens after a few messages. Been this way for a while, and also applies to Tinder. But since this isn't a data breach, they're not required to report it by law. But it's a major PR issue. Just be aware."
A S,"Had this app for maybe a week and already getting phantom matches, but can't see who I matched with unless I uninstall then reinstall. Back to Tinder..."
grant lambert,Im guessing bumble wasnt turning a profit so now its just yellow tinder. All the stuff that made this app better is now behind a pay wall.
Jeff,This app sucks worse than tinder
Dark Protons,"THIS DATING APP IS THE WORST APP EVER. COMPARE TO OTHER DATING APPS LIKE TINDER THAT ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE A LOT OF SWIPES FOR NON-SUBSCRIBERS, THIS APP AFTER A FEW SWIPES YOU RUN OUT OF SWIPES AND ITS BEEN TWO DAYS AND STILL I CANT SWIPE BECAUSE THE SYSTEM DOESNT ALLLOW ME AND JUST SAY COME BACK TOMORROW BUT IT'S ALREAFY DAY 2"
G Mav,I can't say much relationship wise as I'm still single but this is by far the best app because it lets the woman message first. This saves a lot of time unlike tinder that can leave you waiting for days. I also found women here want relationships and children which is a HUGE bonus. 10/10 may lay down money and see how it goes.
James Bestbier,"Your algorithms are garbage. Tinder remains the gold standard, and that says all that needs to be said. How utterly embarrassing"
Nioe Hugs,"Didn't use it in a whole week then told me I've to upgrade to see more people! Wait till tomorrow? Lol! No point in using this unless you are willing to pay what's already free on tinder, absurd!"
Michael,Tried the premium for a month. Waste of time. Doesn't result in more matches and the matches it DID result in were all our of the distance range I had picked in my settings. Wish I could get my money back. It's no better than tinder. In fact I think tinder resulted in better quality matches. Avoid this one.
LayofAutumn,Not very different from tinder. Plus this app want money for simple stuff like seeng who liked you.
Jah Someting,Fresh idea..but women never speak first so every time i match with someone & give them the extended time on top of that and still never get a msg....how do you have 48 hrs and cant think of anything to say...? Matchmaking on this app is so pointless. Tried to for a day pass and even that didnt work. Avoid this app. Your better with TINDER.
Dimitrios Chatzos,The problem with the matches is the biggest and important one. If you don't pay the App may let you without match days and days. The premium is 30 euros per month and Tinder 18/20euros per month. You need to change your charge policy and fix the amount of swipes someone can do.
Rebius Noir,Almost like tinder without the possibility to write your matches. And there are also almost no matches if you don't swipe everything. Edit: Template answeres won't give you more stars.
Ashish Saikia,"Although the unique features of this app is quite good but the ultra-feminist approach is very much annoying. If it would have been like Tinder then it could have gain widespread popularity among the masses. This feature is also hampering your market. We all know that women usually doesn't make the first move, specially towards a stranger. I hope the owner and the marketing team will understand this thing. Other than that the other features are upto the mark.."
Peter monk,"Bumble is awful. Try it for free but do not pay. Match is far better value and you stand a chance of talking to a person, plus profiles on match are more serious about actually dating. There is no perfect dating site/app but there are better quality and all the click bait leach sites, of which Bumble and tinder are two. Most of the female profiles on Bumble are attention seekers who have no intention of chatting or dating anyone. Match isn't perfect, but it's considerably better than Bumble."
nick dorsey,Cons you into spending money by intentionally limiting who sees your profile and how many people you can swipe on. Discriminates against gun owners by moderating photos. Welcome to feminist Tinder 🤷🏻‍♂️
Jonathan Russell,I think there are less users in my area compared to other apps so I get less matches than on tinder. I like that it gives you 24 hours to make a move because otherwise my anxiety would make me not message anyone. The ads aren't too bad either. Overall a good app.
Noel Torres,Bumble is such a great experience! Forget about Tinder!
Arturo Ibarra,Better than tinder for sure but they need a filter to factor out weight. Call me shallow but it is what it is. People got preferences.
Keith Deel,"Worst dating app on the playstore. You will be banned for no reason and the support is the worst I've ever seen. Do not waste your time or your data to download this. Better off going with badoo, tinder, or clover. The reply to my comment is a lie. I've made multiple accounts and every single one is banned within a day for being ""under 18"". DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS APP"
Ja`red Wheeler,Better than tinder but still not great. No fake profiles is a relief but I've been told by multiple people that bumble el send a gif message for them upon matching. That's kind of suspect. Like the different modes too.
Joey Hinkle,It'd decent. Definitely better than tinder for sure
henriquè Nare,"Hey I thought the comments were wrong or over-exaggurating but here we are. Bro just use Tinder, unfortunately it's better and doesn't have much of a payment hurdle unlike this app"
Virgil Leore,"Uh, so in the month and a half I've used it, I had 2 matches. Both of them sent me a bland intro of ""heyy"" with okcupid/tinder/fb dating, I have 64 matches and I've had some interesting conversations and meet ups."
Tim Bur,Poor app. Tinder is better.
you don't need to know,"Very user friendly, and good at matching you. With someone of youe interest. Also NOT* money hungry like tinder so...itll get 5 stars if I ever get a match."
Tonita Queta Parks,An app just like tinder or probably worse if they allow the women to be the first person to reach out. This app has too many swipes and hard to find anyone willing to take you out. If they do you get ghosted and the person does not really care that they wasted your time. It is just another hookup app next to tinder.
Luke ಥ‿ಥ,It's not Tinder
arjun kapoor,"Pretty disappointed. My picture with absolutely no issues gets moderated and support has not gotten back to me. I get plenty of matches on Hinge / Tinder, none on bumble."
Alex Lavenus,Just stick to Tinder
Zed,Would give it 0 stars if I could. Absolutely rubbish. Not a single like or match since I joined with paying. I tested my profile on both tinder and this and tinder is actually doing a better job which is just shocking. Please sort this out.
Anusmita Mohapatra,This is better than tinder.
Henry Langford,Better than Tinder at least.
Michele Schultz,"Bumble used less megabytes especially if it's a hybrid unless if you're seeking to network and expand your female friend group. Bumble filter will stay in the location of who you want to date, meetup via BFF, and Bizz. Out of Facebook dating, Tinder, Hinge, Bumble used less megabytes if you use all three."
Kabu Doe,This app is trash. I experienced nothing but glitches and ghosts... better off with Tinder ffs.
Chris Lebron,Better than tinder... free to message and makesnit easier to come up with icebreakers if they complete their profile
Jimirio,"I downloaded the app and matched someone instantly that I already really like. I used Tinder for days and it was just full of hollow headed thots. And girls message first, so you know they are interested. Okay, I'm a believer. Results possibly not typical."
Drinking Bleach,Absolutely dogshit. Just get Tinder
David A,"Honestly a lot better than Tinder, just not as many people. I love that the photo verification was added, but it would be better if photo verification was required before swiping on anyone to prevent scammers & catfishing. Bff & biz section is very unique, bff could be improved by allowing people to swipe on the opposite sex though."
Ronak Jiwani,Third class app.. Worst app ever seen.. Just time waste nothing else..copy of tinder.. No response from someone..!
Fareed _,"I almost never write reviews on apps, but I’ve been compelled to do so in this case because of how badly their support staff has been in responding to my requests for an explanation as to why I can’t log into the app. I’ve had Bumble for a long time, I even bought the lifetime subscription for it, but as of last week, I haven’t been able to log into the app. I tried reaching out to the app’s support staff through Twitter, Facebook, email, and their “contact us” form on their support page, and still no response. At this point I’m assuming they’ve blocked my account, and are just good with losing a paying customer without giving an explanation as to why I’ve been blocked. I wouldn’t recommend supporting an app like this when other apps (Tinder, Hinge) give you a similar experience without the lack of transparency. PS. If you look through the 1 star reviews on this app, you'll see that bumble has responded to almost everyone by saying to message them on twitter or email them at their support email address. I'm expecting such a response on this review too. The sad part is that I've been trying to reach out to them through both these methods, and I've only gotten complete radio silence."
Matt Brown,Like Tinder but there aren't fake profiles here
Nathan Miltenburg,It's funny how this app is even worse than tinder 😆. First few days you get overflowed by matches and after 3 days they die down to 0 to 3 a day. With mostly 0. However it will give you more matches if you don't use it for a few days. Coincidence? I THINK NOT! But jokes aside. The app feels like a clear lie and I wouldn't even consider paying for it and i haven't even checked the prices yet. 4 out 10
Declan Lynch,"Well, I got banned from tinder so this will have to do. Better than hinge imo."
Sam Hshs,Very bad application ! They banned me for no reason ! Better for people use other app can trust like TINDER ! Bad experience with this app
evueneD redarhcS,New to the app. So far very convenient and smart. Similar to Tinder and more expensive but I like the features. Let see how goes.
James Bischoff,"Have always enjoyed Bumble...quick, efficient and female making first contact is a smart/interesting feature. The 'upgrades' are a bit expensive....might want to revisit pricing, maybe a 30% drop influenced enough new 'users' to create a net/net profit--? Consider. But, again, my experience with the app has been positive and would recommend over Tinder to any one who asks. Be well. Jay"
Michael Radcliffe,Better than tinder I guess.
hu3,Pleasantly surprised. Better alternative to Tinder and with some interesting inbuilt features.
Out Of Rehab,This is where all the rejected people from tinder end up. Not saying tinder is good - far from that - but this takes the cake.
Abhinav,"Maybe I'm unattractive and have a boring bio but with identical bio and pictures I get hanful of matches on Tinder every week. My conclusion is that unless you're paying for their services, your profile will automatically will placed lower in the queue (if shown at all) by their algorithm."
Jack Matheson,"So I got catfished by a fat girl. While stuck on her couch planning my escape, her roommates tinder natch showed up. One if my best friends walked through the door. We both bail and go grab a beer (5 stars for the drunk fest that followed)"
Eldon Coutinho,"I use to like this app. Quite different from Tinder. and you used to get some genuine matches. However,of late the team seems to have resorted to the sort of profile management, that the profile that likes you has been pulled off from the list you get to swipe. They resort to this means in order to make you pay to find out the likes. Either that I genuinely aint recieving profiles that liked me. Either way my moneys on the former. I might delete the app if the problem continues."
Garrison Hyde,Amazing dating app have gone on more dates using this app compared to tinder. I wish you didn't have to pay to use certain features but overall recommend using this app for dating.
Vinyl Wrapper,"Honestly so far the best app. I got engaged to my last Tinder date, turns out I was super wrong. Here the fact that women have the power to make the first move helps a lot on matching with people who are actually interested in knowing you. Can't wait to get engaged (and hopefully marry) my first Bumble date as I haven't been on a date from Bumble yet. It will be the last first date with Bumble's help :) Love the app so far."
Aman J97,"Worst app I have never expected an to show all the tym that you have reached the limit come back tomorrow. It can happen once or twice due to technical glitch but how come all the tym this is happening. Srsly, tinder is better then this I guess at least they do tell out of like n all but this app sucks."
Zatro Gamer,"Good app. More relationship minded setup with more relationship minded people than tinder, but you still get both sides of the coin. Premium features really expensive."
Ellie H,"So far so good, preferred over tinder"
Vipin Wadhwa,use this app before some time for orgeic swipes but its not working but now I was paid two months for subscription but found nothing and waste my money and time and waste my energy for swiping 5000 profiles and I was also contect to developer team to take a action and check the technical issue behind this but they r taking too much time to reply my problem is as it is. its seriously hurting me and everyone plz don't waste ur time with this app and us tinder or happen it's working good feel safe
Bird Harris,I've spoken to and met as many women using Candy Crush as a dating app as I have using Bumble. Except Candy Crush hasn't wasted any of my time because I've never played it. I don't know if I've been shadow banned for some unknown reason or maybe I'm just that ugly. So save your time and don't bother with this. Edit: I've had multiple friends optimise my profile for what they look for when swiping. Tinder seems to be the better option still.
James Demaio,I met the love of my life after she rejected me on tinder. 10/10
Juan David Vanegas,"The likes you give to others doesn't appear to them ever instead they pay. It also is the same with the likes you receive. They could have invented a fairer system as Tinder which I still prefer to use, even to pay"
Siddharth Shorot,I like tinder better becoz I get matches so I know the system works. It tell me about how many people I might have potential match with.... maybe you can improve certain aspects in bumble just saying
Vijay Motla,Worst app i am using to 2 months continuously but no match yet. This app just waste your time. Tinder is better then this app. I will never recommend for using this app.
Sharky LeBlanc,"The description is contradictory to how it works. It doesn't help you meet people or chat. I've never met anyone from here, and it's been months since I've talked to anyone here, despite using it daily, and (regrettably) spending plenty of money on it. This is the one big name app that isn't owned by Match Group, but you wouldn't know it by looking at it. They keep updating to basically become Tinder 2. Also, please add a character minimum for the initial message thing."
Kunal Srivastava,"Good for browsing people in diff places on this app not to match. To match you might have a higher chance on tinder lol.. I bought the lifetime membership xD (yea sed date lyf atm) after 1 week+ use feel duped, I'd suggest tinder plus instead for the same money.. At least it works better than 0% chance on this app.."
pratik astro saha,It seriously doesn't favour the male demographic. Almost never your account gonna pop up cause you don't pay money for it . It's worse than Tinder and I mean it
Declan Carter,"This app is garbage, just stick to tinder"
Mohammad Sharifi,"Bumble advertises a great idea, but is highly inefficient. My experience is that you get couple matches the first couple days, and then they stop showing your profile to people. instead they start pushing you to pay for Spotlight etc. I think Tinder is a very random app but still better than Bumble. If you think I'm biased there's also an article by Treena Orchard about her experience with Bumble. I personally don't recommend this app as its method is not working. Edit 2021-still the same issue."
Jay Shreve,Another dating app that's useless and a 100% rip off of tinder. But made even worse by having only women send the first message. MOST WOMEN DON'T DO THAT.
Prayash Giria,"Better than Tinder, worse than Hinge. This used to be a nicer, simpler app before they tweaked the algorithm to encourage subscriptions. The bees in my hive NEVER turn up in my feed now, even if I get to the point that there's no one left to swipe on. PS - Developer response is an automated bot statement. I have plenty of bees who've liked my profile, so I do not need to 'improve' it. I'll get matches only when the algorithm relents and actually let's these bees into my swipe feed."
PA C,One of the worst app best is tinder I got 5 match without any premium service On this I paid still not even a single match Whatever match is there no reply mince it's fake app do not download
Tommy Peycke,Interface seems decent and I was done with the bots on Tinder.
Chuck Dude,"Limited swipes in this update? Ehh... Still an ok app, much better than Tinder."
Derek Brodie,"much better than tinder, matches that are actually matches! and that live on this side of the border... I'm good on all that, done."
Hendra,Better use tinder
Tristan Myrtle,Better than tinder.....
Sean Flinn,"It's okay. Flakey women abound, it is a dating app. Much better than tinder could ever hope to be, but dang, is that bar low anyways."
Sonika Agarwal,"Why is the swiping limit so low? ""Limiting to foster genuine connections"" is very much BS & just a way to earn money. Why would I pay for more swipes when I can just go on tinder/hinge or literally any other dating app? The only thing bumble has going for them is the BFF feature which is also sub par cuz a) it's only for the same sex & b) if you used up your swipes on Date, well too bad for you, cuz now you have 0 swipes to use on BFF even though you didn't even use BFF."
Da Mighty Moo_Stache,"If you're gunna get a dating app, get tinder. Bumble runs out of swipes in seconds unless u give em cash but then youll run out of ppl in ur area anyway. It has a really janky layout where its really focused around swiping based on looks coz u have to scroll through their whole page just to find out where they live. I also find the 'women message first' aspect slightly sexist as its got different rules for men and women, as if datin ain't unbalanced enough with ghost chicks and way too many boys"
Abel Mescua,"I found wonderful people by using it for one week, much better than Tinder. Highly recommended :)"
De Fowl,Doesn't work worse than pof(plenty of fish) or tinder.
Mai Phương Lê Thị,Mình thấy app này khá hay ho. K rườm rà và toxic như Tinder :v match và trò chuyện được kha khá. Nma app này còn khá mới mẻ nên chưa nhìu người dùng nên match được hơi ít. Mn cố gắng kiên nhẫn 1 xíu :v
taylor gray,I'm so tired of every photo I upload getting flagged for no reason other than the stupid AI. I'm going to go back to Tinder and I advise you to just all do the same.
ohhah moss,"I met my girlfriend on here, we're been together for almost two years, she's 100% the one. Bumble is a place for people to look for serious relationships. If you're ready to find that special someone, ditch tinder and join Bumble!"
James Henry,A good alternative if you've exhausted Tinder
Prem Verma,"Best app ever. Never download tinder. I got my motivation, reason to sleep less and work more here. May be I was lucky💜. Hoping you would get lucky too. 😉"
Dozzer17,Ive pumped alot of money into this and i dont think im even getting seen conmpared to my likes and matches on tinder. I love the fact its profiles but whats the point if you dont show up for people you liked. Absolute joke of an app.
Plus Minus,Worst Dating App If you want to ask any query or something you won't be able to send message to the customer care of Bumble it always gives a error message More importantly you can't initiate a communication . I WANTED to purchase Premium plan but so lame it is not even allowing me to purchase that plan My money saved because of that error 😅 Even Tinder is better than this but that is little expensive if we compare Gold plan of Tinder with Premium plaN Still no reply received after email.Worst
Simon Burkhardt,So much more professional than Tinder. Could you please add a setting to change the language of the app instead of using the system language?
SR388,Not any better than Tinder. Avoid.
William Mercer,"Better than Tinder, better than POF. It's refreshing that girls have to make the move. It's a little different. Lots of nice people who actually make an effort to talk to you."
Tyler Williamson,"Its literally the same as tinder, a waste of time. Stay away."
E. Williams,"Honestly didn't see a big difference between this & Tinder. They talk about quality & have all these rules, but in the end, they are the same, except this hijacks your pics. Once uploaded, they won't always let you delete it. I had a pic which CLEARLY showed my face, but b/c I had added hashtags IN THE CORNER-NOT obscuring my face-it wasn't allowed. I've seen main pics of men's profiles w/ no face-sometimes no humans at all-yet, I can't even delete my account w/o uploading a pic 1st. Deleted."
Noel Góis,This app is pretty cool! Much better than Tinder!
Skylar McClean,"It's low key sexist but I get it, men are overwhelming. But it takes a week before I can start matching again. I think I'll stick to tinder."
district washington,"Been reading and watching a documentary about this app and tinder and hinge i dont like bumble the thing that the women have to choose and is good because that gave wome ""voice"" is bulls once that you match they the men, never ever say not even a f hello to you at all..tinder is like a porno prostitution site bs all of them and all is a lie simple as that..you can say whatever but once you match with men they NEVER say a hello .. felt like am begging for a nice chat ..men don't contact you atall"
mahesh bhagwani,"It's not at all worthfu to pay for Membership. It says that's by buying Membership you can increase your chances of getting more matches but it doesn't even Stand on it's own words. Brought one week Membership didn't even got a single match after it. Membership wise it's not at all upto the mark, even Tinder get you few matches after you buy their Membership. Bumble you have to work more hard to beat tinder. App's Interface is very good and accessibility 5 Star for it but Membership is worthles."
Freddy Junior,"Pretty much trash. It's like tinder where users are both blindly swiping unless you pay significant $ to actually see who has swiped you, or to have them see that you swiped. It costs about $1 per swipe. Also, when you pay, the quality of matches drops off significantly."
Balaji .D,Equally or more useless than Tinder. Atleast tinder is better.
Sourabh Madane,This app is too good rather than tinder Bt unfortunately i don't get any match yet😭😬 bt all over its a grate😀💫
william weatherby,Easy to use. Not as trashy as tinder
Sundram Singh,"Worst app that can one have , it doesn't match your profile untill you purchase their so called premium and doesn't show the profiles which swipe right on you , so that you have to buy their premium. I wouldn't suggest this app my friends . It is completely your waste of time amd you should switch on other apps like tinder , which is a way better than bumble .Now i am going to uninstall it and will never suggest this to anyone ."
Dewayne w,"Finally decided to uninstall - the app is not useful in the slightest for finding a actual relationship. The majority of females who use bumble aren't serious, aren't pro active enough & the rest use it for ego boosts because of covid-19 restrictions or are fake profiles. Either way it's not worth using. The same people who made Tinder run Bumble - that should tell you everything you need to know.... Out of everything I said all they got out of it was fake profiles SMH"
TJ Goines,They need to put a countdown for when you can start to swipe again...like tinder does. Hell tinder even sends you a notification letting you know when you can start to swipe again. I don't have time to keep checking the app all day to see when I can start to swipe. I actually forget about the app because of this. Other than that it is a good app. Just keep us up to date when we can swipe. Some of us don't live on this app or stay on our phones 24/7 to keep checking.
Chris. P Bacon,A tinder clone with same in-app begging for basic features. Girls just use it for attention so don't waste your time.
JOSE TODAY,Horrible app worse than tinder and other dating apps SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Use it on other apps this ain't it Save your money!! Me and my friends upgraded to premium And it didn't get better SAVE YOUR MONEY App is wack for the price of premium there is better options from the plethora of dating apps. SAVE YOUR MONEY
Amit Carbyne,It's better than tinder
Chill Will,Better than tinder
Hartsock2009,"Completed profile, sadly some matches but not as many as tinder"
David,"Bumble is a good dating app I've used it a few times. I like the fact that photo verification was added, but I feel it should be a requirement before swiping on anyone. The bff section could be improved if you could swipe on the opposite sex to make platonic friends. The biggest turn off is that there aren't as many people on here as Tinder. And the notifications are very annoying when you receive a notifications telling you that you can now swipe but you open the app and can't yet..."
Nicholas Berggren,It's pretty cool very easy to navigate and use slightly worse than tinder but not that bad except for the whole you can't see people who like your profile thing... That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen for a DATING app
Lakhbir Dhajan,same as tinder
Dani Kash,"People are tripping in these reviews like FORREAL! This is a great app! I likevit way better than Tinder. Its fresh and the features are fun. I love the random questions and definately love the profiles and how its set up. Makes getting to know someone interesting before even having a conversation. I personally LOVE the 24 hour to message back feature. If a person is genuinely interested in you, they will MAKE TIME to send a 5 min message out of their day. Thats the best feature. Great App!!!"
Iosu V,"Great app but more people need to get on it. At least here in Norway, if didnt take long before it run out of people even when i set it to the widest paraneters it allows. BUT having said that, i love the way it works, it makes people engage with you or loose you forever so thats good, way better results than tinder. Matched and talked to a few interesting people despite the low amount of users. Lets hope we can make it a date now."
Mark Z,"Just like tinder, this app has paywall after paywall"
ranjit pawar,"Good app.. Most profiles are genuine and have pictures unlike Tinder. Would Love if it makes real verified pictures absolutely necessary. However, as of now their verification feature needs lot of work as the camera doesn't detect the person even after several attempts.."
Blake Guidry,"I think Bumble has a great approach to their app and the format produces some opportunity to have conversation and to get to know people. I think Bumble takes a lot of pressure off of women by not having a million dudes inundating them with unwanted messages, but also places some urgency on messaging matches by putting a time limit on it. Some mass messaging still occurs with people trying to keep matches for later but much less than other apps like tinder. I exclusively use Bumble now tbh."
Luis Santos,"At first glance it appears vastly superior to Tinder. There's a lot more data on profiles and you can even use it for filtering. But the end result is still the same. 3 matches on day one, but 0 messages. Now it's been 3 days since I installed the spp and there's no more users to swipe. I know you want to empower women and that's great, but until there's a penalty for ghosting, matching without reply or an inactivity indicator, online etiquette will remain dreadful. We all deserve more respect."
Shadow Abbott,"Better then Tinder. Get less bots and catfish, and everyone on it is real."
Zay,Update: still trash and even worse than before. Like I said download Tinder or even Facebook dating. This app and its developers are trash and will steal money from you. Do not download this app. Trash app. Download Tinder instead trust me. Takes awhile but at least the profiles and matches are real. This app sucks. Hands down one of the worst by far! Developers are trash and repetitive and do nothing to make their app a better experience. Wanna blow money for no reason get this app.
Dhairya Thakkar,Better than Tinder.
Stealth7500,"Tough in a small, conservative market, but isn't too bad. Almost no fake accounts like Tinder or the similar. Women send the first message. Most of the time it's ""Hey,"" so you're still doing the opening, but occasionally it's much more compelling. Good to shake things up. For paid, you can buy a lifetime of premium, which I haven't seen elsewhere. It's infinite likes, infinite extends, extra premium likes a week. I'd say Bumble still has life in it."
Chow Kit,Great app! So much better than Tinder! 😝
Nick Pennington,"What's really amusing is how you get less matches than tinder, and you have to wait twice as long for your ""likes"" to reset whereas Tinder is 12. I couldn't imagine paying $1 for anything on this site when you get better features, for free, everywhere else. El oh el."
Jarrod Bagwell,I'm going to be honest with you all these apps for dating like tinder bumble bubble whatever they're all connected somehow cuz they're all the same they don't verify the accounts the women on there aren't the women they say they are there's so many fake accounts it's not real your chances of finding someone on here is not going to work I mean it's literally a one out of a million things to actually find true love on here. Let's just say the pictures are 100% real but the profile isn't real.
sunny sehrawat,I bought 30 spotlight coins worth 2k rs. And all i got 3 matches from which no one text. Whereas on tinder i got 150 matches by spending 2.5k rs. Most of my matches were from nearby and they were on bumble too and they told me they never saw my profile. I raised a complaint to bumble about this nd also give a feedback about their shity algorithm nd i got no response. That's fine by me if u want to create a girls app but don't cheat on with our money. Happy unsubscribe it till they gets it right
Joshua Fields,"This app sucks like tinder, just another waste of time, no matches no messages. I wish I could give it a 0 out of 5 stars. It just causes me more depression."
Anonymous,The app sucks. It keeps lagging. Tinder is much much better
Stephen Kumalo,"Unlike Tinder, I can actually get customer service through an email, and I don't get banned on Bumble without knowing why, or for no apparent reason. Tinder lets its members ban each other with no looking in to anything. That, and I want Bumble to overtake Tinder is why I am giving this a 5 stars."
Christopher OLoughlin,Much much better than Tinder.
Ian Tait,"In only a couple of days I've seemingly run out of users to view near me so the system is showing me folk outside that range. Its early days for me on this attempt but its not looking promising. The tinder swipe mechanics feel far too limited and I haven't had a match yet so I cant comment on that system. Its nice that you can flexibly pay for the advanced features down to a single day, but it's annoying that you have to pay for premium to see someone who ""liked"" your profile"
miguel calderon,"Complete joke. A good concept idea, reverse and have women message first. Except women don't message, they don't message first on POF or tinder. Yea I've got likes but not a single person will actually message. I've sent messages on other apps gotten replies good conversation and bad. But this app where the woman has to make contact."
Sagar manocha,I still stand by my review that bumble has become yellow tinder by disabling users to filter out unverified profiles. One has to just put up pics and add insta/sc/fb ids to offer digital marketing or escort services. If u really do what u claim then u wouldn't have charged for the privilege to filter unverified profiles.
William McDevitt,About as bad as tinder now. Nothing but a month grab.
dimebag330,100% better then tinder
John,"Women rarely message anything first lol and if they do its just ""hi"" lol nice try but this app is another tinder"
TEXA5 MADE 210,Good overall. You can actually find people unlike Tinder who actually want a relationship or at least go on a date. Tinder its either they ghost you or they don't show up LMAO definitely a good app.
Nurul Ansari,"This app is a scam,tinder is better than his. If you get any like then too this app want you to pay to proceed further 🤦‍♂️"
Callum Turner,"By far the worst dating app I have ever used. It's full of inactive users just looking for IG followers. I bought 5 ""spotlights"" after getting bombarded with ads for them and didn't receive a single 'like' when I used them. I did a boost on tinder and got 11 likes with the same pics/bio so ik bumble is the issue. I also reported an abusive user only for them to pop up again a week later. Biggest waste of time and the premise of ""girls message first"" is pointless bc they never do."
Sean Boshoff,"The App used to work. Then now everytime I try to use it it'll just be loading forever. Can't read any messages and can't reply to existing questions. Poor service, even worse customer service and my recommendation would be - Tinder, Badoo or anything else. Just avoid the Bumble bullsh*t."
Joff and Ava Willson,I think it's just as good as tinder if not better...I only have the two dating apps . tinder and bumble .Any other dating app is fake chicks getting you to spend credits .Really have to be careful people.Bumble is trust worthy real people looking for relationships.
David ',"With the new restrictions and reduced functionality, Bumble is now effectively the same as Tinder, but with less users and more restrictions. Don't waste your time on this app. No doubt some Analyst has worked out they'll earn increased overall revenue from a smaller amount of guys by doing this, but this is at the expense of the majority of users."
Patrick,Was hoping this would be better than tinder but once again micro transactions have ruined it
Gorden Lamb,"Like most online dating apps I've surveyed, 98% of the girls you find are not exactly high quality. I, too, reached the bottom of the barrel pretty quickly. Glad I didn't pay for more than a day! Already cancelled the recurring payments. (And just how is this any different from a handicapped version of Tinder? The only ""feature"" is the guys' inability to msg! Sooo innovative, Whitney.)"
Justin Marques,"I am shown matches but none of them actually show up when i swipe. I'll use my all my daily swipes and not match w any of the 50 ""Matches"" bumble says i have. Use tinder"
Daniel,"Bumble is better than tinder and badoo for a lot , is an app that try to be good , but the costs in colombia are to expensy ,I think bumble should see the economy in the respective country before putting costs"
Tiffany Cheng,Not a great user interface and the app is trying more and more to copycat Tinder's features. The user base is awkward guys that have a palpable and severe fear of rejection.
Sparsh rawatkar,"Worst app I've been using this app for almost 2-3 months , totally waste of money and time , Try truly madly and tinder"
Colin Briggs,"Its ok, real profiles for a change which is a good start. They took out all the little things that made this different and turned it into a more expensive Tinder with less features. £35 for 1 month of premium. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Update: you're also now limited to the amount of folk you can swipe on in a day, unless of course you upgrade to premium. An absolute rip off and reduced down to 1 star. If i could vote 0 stars i would, purely for being complete money grabbers."
Tomas,So much potential but letting it down with the filtering bugs. Already raised few technical tickets about broken filtering criterias. But they don't seem to do any updates to an app yet. I think Bumble is better than Tinder as it allows more filters to apply to the profiles and you can actually fill those details on your profile as well. But the end result is not good if filters are broken. Useless notifications are also annoying - when they tell you to check your profile but profile is blank.
kartik chandra,Why have you started being tinder nowadays. All these markets tacts will only be for upper class and upper-middle class. Just saying. Also why did you deleted the paytm payment option? Is it because of gstore?
Jackson Gable,"Highly recommend! Bumble has a great user interface, is easy & fun to use, and has great people! I recommend it over any other dating app. It's easily my favorite, and I'll choose it any day over Tinder, OKCupid, you name it. The free features are sleek, and if you wanna go for either of the paid tiers (Boost & Premium), their features are excellent, and very reasonably priced."
qeylIS Morgenstern,Same deal as Tinder - everyone is casual but doesn't want to admit it. Glad I never met anyone from this platform.
Mark Shaw,"Why do apps like Bumble and Tinder require FB sign in?? Whom I wish to meet and date has sod all to do with FB. I find this requirement ridiculous and objectionable! Uninstalled, June 21, 2017. Even after 4 years, reading through the reviews here, I still see you insist on using Twitter and FB — two of the most notorious, social media apps on the planet. Not everyone uses these disgraceful, crooked platforms. So why do insist on this ridiculous premise??"
ArticruciA Williams,I am an attractive and over 6ft male who can't get any matches. Your app is terrible and a scam. Tinder is better.
Keelan McDougall,It does what it says but you can only swipe like 5 people every other day. Compared to the opportunities tinder offers it seems almost pointless
Abhay Dubey,You can't adjust the place of match of your choice like tinder allows
Alexander Laurence,"Bumble used to be the best dating app, which actually surpassed Tinder. But their reporting system is a complete joke. If someone reports you on a partner platform (i.e. Badoo) then your account gets completely blocked from Bumble too with no chance of appeal or hearing from your side. If you try emailing or contacting support, they just tell you to refer to the rules without any sympathy. I used to defend Bumble as a paying customer, but I can no longer be a supporter let alone a customer of this atrocious app. Be warned."
Paul Hill,Became money hungry like Tinder...
Daniel Jakob,"I've found the app to be pretty good, the lack of blatantly objectifying photos is a real plus, unfortunately the customer service responses seem robotic as they disregard the content of the messages, the most frustrating thing is that the FAQ states that everyone gets two advanced filters to use, but this in no longer the case, so not only does the app not deliver what is advertised, but also one of the features that helped this app stand apart is now gone - it's no better than tinder now"
J K,So many escorts and fake profiles yet they kick men off for calling them out. Very female bias moderators go to tinder. Say what you want every other profile has a snapchat or Instagram just looking for more followers.
Jan Jr Brants,"Concept is good on paper, having ladies make the first move. But doesn't really work as intended. It's basically the same as Tinder, except you can't send an ice breaker as a male."
Sam Joshi,"Worst app ever , please.dont install it First of all this app does a fake advertisement so that you will buy one of it's plan. You will get a pop frequently to buy the beeline so that you can see who has liked you and also it shoes some pixelated image which makes you think that you are liked by some people but actually you are not. The moment you will buy the plan and go to the liked section you will find it's empty. Tinder is better than this app atleast it has genuine people not bots."
Dave J,"Money wise it's like Tinder, it costs you money to super like, it costs you money to set up filters, it costs you money to recall a false swipe, everything costs you. But they get one extra star cause the women here at least look decent unlike on Tinder. ------------ Edit: Why do I get misleading emails and notifications from you guys. It says I have a like, I check, nobody. Not the first time. Notifications off, continues, then I'll leave one star and uninstall."
ted krieg,Way better then tinder
Milan Shah,Every other dating app I have I get matches. This app is either dead or the algorithm is never even showing my profile. I usually use up all my swipes for the day because it's said to increase your chance of being shown... but still nothing. Tinder and hinge are better.
Sam N,"Lousy that you not only get fake notifications for likes and potential matches, but have to pay to see people who like you AND put yourself in the spotlight. It's pretty ironic that this app touts itself as ""women making the first move"" and other faux-progressive nonsense when Hinge at least let's YOU SEE who likes you and stuff. This app is trash and takes advantage of lonely women in the guise of being ""woman friendly"". May as well be on the same tier as Tinder, which is absolute trash."
Monica Schwab,I feel very safe using this app unlike tinder.
Ruan Van Staalduinen,"Way better, and higher quality than Tinder"
Vincent,"As mentioned by others, its pretty much the same as tinder does. Tells you youve got likes but never matches. I would say its cheaper and easier to pay for prostitutes to meet women than using this lousy money farm. EDIT: also now it seems that ive been banned from swiping. Maybe because of the bad review?"
Lisa W,"very few matches, at least most are not fake like on Tinder so that is a plus"
Matt Soria,SO MUCH BETTER THEN TINDER!
satellitesmediate,total waste of time. with tinder I got matches at least weekly. hinge I got matches several times a month. bumble I tried for six months and never got a single match. don't bother
Edzel lewis0,It's good. Since they blocked me in Tinder
AGREG2 1,"So basically, unless you spend alot of money to buy premium and spotlight you wont have any likes of matches of any sort! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!! I hope the developers read this! Just get TINDER! !!!!!!!!!!"
Argha Bhattacharya,"Superb experience... Better crowd than tinder till date. Less dust. More grain. Overall UI is Okeish but lacks dark mode. Great that I can quote text to reply. These are small things in UI that are useful. Dark mode or different color mode in & out of dark mode like messanger will be great to improve overall experience. Improve the filters & their efficiency, like the location range filter. I should also be able to select regions in the city rather than just random distance based. Good Luck."
Learn2PvP,A much better tinder
Thomas Carstensen,"I like the fact that women are the first ones to initiate the conversation which is a lot better than Tinder (although it isn't guaranteed that they write;probably less than 50%) but I've had the app for a while now, and I've apparently gone through every single profile and I've gotten 2 matches where none have actually written anything. Easiest way would be increasing your distance but how many people are willing to drive more than 80km to meet someone? I'll change my review if it gets fixed"
Eduardo Freitas,Better than Tinder
Raj Thakrar,More than 48 hours and its still reviewing the photo for verification. Too slow. Tinder rather verified in 2 mins.
Kaan Göksal,"Much better than tinder, however the paid functionalities are broken. I paid to get the beeline (see your likes) i get email notifications on who liked me. However on the app it is always blank. I have to swipe on everyone to find my match. Support doesnt care nor reply.. They will only care if there is a monetary issue (many people stop paying)"
Vision 2030,"Let's be honest women preferred to be hunted, they rearly speak first because there just as useless at this as we are. Hence the reason you created the option for ME to rekindle, so you could go against the original idea of this app. The idea of this app is sexist and has the predescibed notion that us guy are already creeps, plus the algorithm is not in our favour already, that's why my tinder looks different from my bumble because this app is lopsided towards toxic feminism.."
mehul jain,I like this app more than Tinder
Jake V,"Okay so far better than Tinder and Badoo. I like the fact women message first. One thing though, I got two swipes tonight and I was out of them? One left, one right with a match and then I'm out for the day and have to wait 24hrs? Seems a bit restrictive. I don't want to have to use other apps because this one only gives me a few swipes. But I may have to if that continues."
Richard Seekins,"Worse dating app ever!.. Any picture you put they take down. I'll stick with tinder,😤"
Chellz xo,"Paid for premium, only shows people states away as if they're in my radius. Not a good look, Bumble. Be better. Tinder has this figured out already."
Gutshotpro,"This app used to be halfway decent, however it has now descended into a money-grabbing scam. I didn't think an app could be worse than tinder, but apparently it can! Whatever you do, don't give them your card details or you will regret it."
William Jones,"Still wish males could atleast introduce themselves, i get alot of matches then nothing. still better than tinder with the bots and the salts, im a gentleman and got banned from tinder for no reason, was never disrespectful, and they refuse to tell me why. i think it was linked to my insta where i had a picture of my rifle. bumble 100% better."
Laura Grace,Great better than Tinder
Allison Mendez,"Pure garbage, don't bother with this, not any better than tinder, if you have big breast you'll just get banned. Everytime I try to post any picture (which are completely normal picture PG photos you could find on my grandma facebook page) of myself I get it banned and I'm moderated because of the size of my body, how am I supposed to use the app if I'm not allowed to use basic feature without being shamed by the staff? Sad to see that my body type is being sexualized by bumble. Do not support"
Charles Tanchuan,The only reason why it was better than tinder was because of the filters. Now that it's gone this is basically inferior to tinder now.
Katie McBrierty,Tries to lure you in with false notifications and is now charging for filters which were previously free and set it apart from other swiping apps. Now just the same as tinder except women messaging first.
Sambasjeansandbooze,"The only advantage is, like tinder, it's all real people here for the most part. Unfortunately, it can no longer compete with Tinder. Back in the day, one had unlimited swipes and this mitigated the number of missed connections do yo the ""girls message first"" feature. Not anymore, meaning without paying a lot more money that Tinder, it's not worth it to download. Further, technically the app sucks. I waited almost 48 hours and had to uninstall and reinstall the app to begin swiping again."
Sam Stringer,"Once, this was the best dating app, hands down. Then they got greedy and took away a bunch of features and made them payed features. No point downloading this, might as well just get tinder."
Red K Radiation,"I took a break from Bumble, as none of the girls were actually messaging me (Girls message first for a reason...), and now my account is gone. (I chose, to sign in with Google for a reason. (It was suggested, by someone I knew...) My account's deletion, added to everything else, led to a one star. (Sorry, but it's true.) Now, I gotta see if my Tinder account still exists..."
Tzu Ngai,"No wow moment here, but clean user interface. Similar to tinder and others, stops pigs from random messages"
Tia Martinson,"Honestly same profiles as on tinder, hinge, or okc except guys are lazy on this one. Repeat profiles, constantly getting through whole deck without a swipe right. The timer feature sucks too, not everyone has 24 hours to send a message, this feature must go. And since this app is basically like all other apps, let either gender make the first move after a match. I hate this site."
Vinícius Rafael,"It's been 3 days and I still can't swipe again. It says I have to pay if I want to see potential new swipes. 3 days, is this a joke? Even tinder is better. Ridiculous app!"
DAVE,"In my experience the woman on here only say ""hi or hey"" to lead off the convo. Ironic seeing as this is a common complaint of women against men on other dating sites. I've come to the conclusion that it seems women are bad conversationalists, at least on Bumble. If you are an average guy ( an 8 or lower) don't bother with Bumble. Think about it. If a women is overflowing with matches , she is only going to respond to 9's and 10's. There's a reason Bumble rating is the same as Tinder or POF"
Mriganka Das,Best app ever. So user friendly and wholesome. Tinder can only dream
Evgeniy Nesgovorov,Better then tinder and badoo
Matt Havoc,"Junk unless you're looking for monogamous, cishet relationships with women who want someone wealthy. Probably the least inclusive dating app out there, even tinder is better than this. If you ever match with someone, you'll never get a message. Then you'll try and ""extend"" that 24 hour window, and still not get a message. But you can always pay to extend! And still get nothing. Absolute waste of time. Suspect all the 5 star reviews are paid for or happened before the switch to pay for feats."
zach weiss,Way better than tinder
Hashirama Senju,It's a decent app. It feels generic it could be split into two Apps one for Adults like tinder and one for dating in my opinion.
Allan Nicome,"Traditionally, many women prefer the guy to message first, so this app is pointless. I get matches, but the women don't say Hello first. It's a waste of time. Tinder is better."
Paula Moses,"Literally the only difference from Tinder is women message first. Which means nothing when majority of matches are from serial right swipers who never reply. Also, says I have a message and go to open it and nothing comes up. Have to force close the app and reopen it for the message to load."
Zach Schram,"(Update: a year later and this still stands ABSOLUTELY true) Creating an app that demands that women start the conversation shows the creators are completely disassociated and removed from how our culture works now. Women willing to start the conversation are insanely rare. So it's great to have a ton of matches only to have none actually say anything. Meanwhile on tinder this is never an issue. Despite their claims that ""millions are matching"" they wont tell you that none of them are talking."
Caleb Limb,I guess it's better than tinder.
Nicholas Scory,Got banned for absolutely no reason just like what tinder did. I treat people with respect and am very polite so I have no idea how I got banned. Would give 0/5 stars if it would let me. Dissapointing
abhishek verma,You won't find match easily .. time wasting I would suggest tinder over this
Maurizio Flores,"Mejor que tinder, más divertido"
Muhammad Musaab,Okay they made Premium WAAAY better. It's actually worth it now. The boost features are finally included. Also the new interest feature is great. Good work Bumble Team. Updated from 1-star to 4-stars. You guys beat Hinge in best bang for buck. **Previous Review**: Marginally better than Tinder. Premium subscription lacks features.
Jaideep Bhagat,It is OK but better than Tinder UI wise
D Sushon,worse than tinder... unless u're trolling 4 manwhores.. baiii boii #nuhh!!
F0RCEFI3LD,Melhor que tinder 😂
Dan LDG,Tinder version 2. Terrible for men to use. This is a paid app with free interface.
A Google user,"I initially had given this app 1 star when I first started using it. I've since changed my rating to a 5, based on my success with the app since then. Way better than Tinder. EDIT: September 1st, 2020. Why am I seeing men/men dressed as women on the female side? Fix this please or I'm going to have to change my rating to 3 stars or less. EDIT: March 2021. I no longer rate this app 5 stars. If I could I'd rate it 0 stars. Updates as well as men dressed as women has ruined this app."
Nikhil Malhotra,Worst. ! It's been a month n half ! Still no match i found ! Issey to bc tinder hai match to ate hai bhle hi ladko atey ho 😂
Danielbassist13,"Badly designed. Same as Tinder, except women send the first message (which isn't bad). Being on here over a year, in a big city, I never had more than 3 likes at once. I only ever got 4 matches that messaged me something besides ""hey"" or ""hi"". It seems people don't actually get this app to date. If that's what you want, you honestly might be better off trying to meet people in real life. Like on Tinder, almost everyone on here is fake and unreasonably selective."
Avi Urmaliya,"After reading 100 of your reviews, I've learnt a lot about you, babe you're deceptively treacherous ! I was researching on dating apps and amidst realised a funfact: Tinder's founder (who have 100M+ downloads, max. userbase & the most well known dating app in the market) net worth is only $300M While the bumble lady (only having 10M+ downloads) have a net worth of 1.2Bn $$. You know how, that you'll understand after reading it's reviews. Why does it have only 3.4✩ rating ? You'll perish bumble !"
Christopher R,Best dating app. Tinder & others don't even compare.
Addy Gil,Tinder is much better in All terms.it doesn't bug you always for verification and doesn't block your account
Erick Alcantara,I ran away from Tinder thinking this app would be any different 🤡
joseph Flippin,"I was kicked off bumble because an ex girlfriend reported me to tinder  because she was jealous and mad when she saw me on bumble.   She told me and laughed about it.  I have no idea what she said.  I think it was unfair to be kicked off and unfair to men who are accused of stuff from jealous people. On here people can report you for any reason and there is zero investigation, or recourse.  Someone can control you by threatening to lick you off by making a false report."
John Lemma,Much better than tinder
Simon Hood,Use to be better than tinder. As a man you need to pay to get anywhere. Introduction of premium doubled the prices and just shows the owner has gotten greedy despite being a billionaire now. I got some likes previously but this app wasn't that successful for me. Can't justify paying these prices now. Don't know how bumble can justify them either.
Darian Enting,"This app likes to pretend it's better than Tinder but it's not. It's more clunky and has less people. If you want an actually good alternative to Tinder, use OkCupid."
HF Photography,"Hide people who liked you behind paywall. So it's deliberately PREVENTING you from matching. Don't support them, shady like the new tinder."
Chris V.,This is one of the worst dating sites/apps. Tinder or POF are preferred over this trashy site. I am a verified user. My name is Chris Violet.
Dyllen Shepherd,App seems to be ok. Handles a lot better than tinder
Michael Harris,Going public with the company stock must have made them greedy. They just hiked the price of one of their basic paid features by 75% - seeing who likes you before you match. Just another sad demonstration of some out-of-touch board of directors ruining a good thing by trying to extract every penny out of the apps patrons. They sure make a big deal out of trying to distinguish themselves from Tinder while looking more and more just like it.
Sumit Kumar Mishra,"Even worse than tinder. The only good thing was to see girls don't try to contact even over here. Many matches initially (80% of which didn't even initiate the conversation) just like on tinder, then booom! All gone and no more matches since last 2 weeks . So pro women even in the virtual world ! Responding to the reply - I had added the maximum number of allowed prompts (i guess 3 or 4) and they were effective since, 2 out of the 3 who initiated the talks talked about that. So please 🙏"
Ano Ny,"""Interests"" - copied from tinder. Copied somehow with an even more ignorant, limited, basic, short pool to choose from. Why don't you JUST LET people write their own specific #hashtags, and then let them filter the matches based on those hashtags? You ************* ******* *** *****! How hard is that? It would relieve so much frustration and help so much and bring literally no ******* downsides! You ******* *****. PS: this review section is much better than the app at finding likeminded matches"
DrunkPauloCosta,"To be honest the women on here seem to have no idea how to impress a man.. Like its just ""Hey"" or ""Hi"" and then they expect me to just do what i have to do on tinder. Why join this app only to stand in the corner looking good?"
VETTE,Apps pretty useless and depending on where you live there just isn't enough options just use tinder instead better chances of actually making friends there even though it doesn't have a BFF feature
Peter Isaacs,Better than Tinder
John Washburn,As shallow of an experience as tinder
Ken Hendricks,Better than Tinder but the subscription cost toi expensive. You'll find more real girls in here compared to Tinder. Do download and find yourself a meaning to love 😉
Mihály Lőrincz,"Way better than Tinder, less time wasted."
Chris Rhodes,"No usable filters. Apparently, the technology to detect the same picture across multiple accounts is too advanced for them. Not as bad as tinder. Yet."
Pakai Zsolt,"Better than tinder, i didn't found yet fake profiles and less instagram models..."
Curtis Meissner,"Made multiple accidental in-app purchases. I contacted them immediately after each instance to explain, yet, they never refunded me. Saddest thing is that you dont even match up or talk with people often. Other apps, like tinder, are more active and engaging. Ultimately, Bumble is a waste of time. And click carefully! Don't be fooled by the money hungry ladies of Bumble."
jezza 1555,"Useless app, shite tinder 2.0"
Joshua Elliott,"Bumble is just a digital pimp! It's the worst... Get tinder. Don't pay for their boosts, it's a racket. Tinder might be shallow and full of catfish but at least you don't suffer through a sea of fake profiles under a veil of disingenuous placation. ** Anyone working at Bum-mer-ble, I'm talking to you! You have the perfect position in a new and profound market, stop squandering it. An accurate representation of your service is 100x more endearing than the hot-rod-red vernier of recycled profiles"
Liam Jennings,"Works better than tinder in my area. The problem with such apps is that its totally dependent on the people where you live. I'll get hundreds of matches on tinder, but no convos. With bumble I get far less matches, but the girls are far more proactive and the results are better."
Radu Nicoara,Really cool app. It has a numver of features on top of Tinder.
Tom Keaton,"1 match in 4 months. I had 100+ matches on tinder and 30+ on hinge in the same time. my guess is there are fewer females here so they are able to be more selectable? Would make sense, but another and most important problem is this: How do you expect women to start and keep a conversation going when the American culture has ingrained into them that men will always initiate? Good dating app concept in theory, but just doesn't work in our society due to gender stereotypes 😒"
Rishab Kaushik,"The app is getting terrible. The online dating was already skewed against men. Earlier I used to get good number of matches. But now there is not even a single match in a month. Another issue is the swipe limit. It is just inaccurate at times and with only 10-15 swipes it gets exhausted. It's just getting money hungry now. If it is not for the swipe limit I would definitely get a match per day. The app was really awesome earlier, it was even better than tinder. Huh Every corporate gets greedy."
Alex K,"Next to useless without paying for premium. The 'women have to message first' feature is it's selling point, I can understand that. But matches expiring in 24 hours serves no purpose except to detract from the already subpar experience of this dating app compared to others like it. The profile UI is better than Tinder, but other than that Tinder is better in every way."
AAA AAA,1. Girls don't get to know initially that they are supposed to text first and instead they wait for guys to text them. 2. Many potential matches are missed due to the 24 hours time limit which is a wrong thing. 3. The special like button must be free at least once or twice a day. Tinder is much better in these regards.
Fernandos Robles,"Very good, i dont like that girls need to talk to you first... But the quality of the people there is better than tinder!"
Nathan Barash,"Had the same number of matches for days now. Only way I'm seeing these matches is if I pay for Beeline, huh? Their algorithm is too unfriendly and anti-consumer. I'll hop over to Tinder."
mediocre_drummer,"It's not a bad app. The UI is good and everything. My only issue is every day I swipe like 3 or 4 people max and it would tell me I needed to upgrade to get more people. Meanwhile, I can swipe like 100 people on tinder and not have to upgrade. Idk."
dave Freiheit,"Its alright, better than tinder, and im hoping that this app will help me find love faster than tinder"
Hugo Chanou,"Pas un seul like ni match, fruitz tinder et Facebook fonctionnent bien mieux"
James Kirchgassner,"My profiles on Tinder and Bumble are identical. Pictures, bio, everything. I have 32 matches on Tinder at time of writing. Bumble? One. I'm convinced that Bumble's algorithm is designed to prevent you from seeing people who've liked you and vice versa, unless you shell out money for an overpriced subscription that doesn't even include half of the available paid features. At this point I just swipe to look at people when bored and don't expect anything out of it."
Thomas Burgess,"Great app! A lot less time wasting than on Tinder. Women message first - a good idea, I think. Your dating preferences / situation is displayed (eg has kids, looking for something serious/casual, etc). Would be 5 stars if there wasn't an issue where I don't receive notifications for messages."
Shivam Benglorkar,Better than tinder . Like the work principal that girls have to make the fist move . User experience is good . It show that how much effort has been put in while making the app . The game of questions is best. 😃
Dallas Wales,"Have had far more luck with Tinder, even for the categories Bumble claims to be about."
Unknown_Kief,"I refuse to pay to know who's liked me, for more likes, or whatever else. Also. Too many ppl with onlyfans that just want you to pay them.... I like it more than tinder though"
Martin Pilkington,"Basically Tinder but women contact you first. However you only get to swipe through people every 48hours, or when it feels like letting you. Dunno why, but it's a stupid feature. Just reset it at 12am everyday? I last used 2 days ago, still can't use. I'm removing a star and deleting. All these apps are the same."
Guy den Blanken,"Bumble used to be (2+ years ago) an app that really tried hard at being better; with competition like Tinder, it's not that hard to be better. It had really strong features that made it by far the more reliable dating app. And they pissed it all away, turning it into nothing more than a yellow tinder clone. Sad really when all features slowly but surely get locked behind pay walls; even though these used to be free. And even the features that are left have gone down hill. Really just sad."
Joe,App hasnt been good for me. They removed alot of great free features and made it cost money. Youre better off with tinder....atleast there your matches stay no matter how busy you are.
Alejandro Kirienko,"Way better than tinder. But there are many unecessary features for ""inclusiveness"""
Evans Wooh,"So far so good, i think its a lot better than tinder"
Priit Kaasik,"I find the app to be better than Tinder, because it's easier to provide information about yourself and I find that it's better when the ladies can initiate the conversation. The only downside is the relatively low userbase."
komal singh,Better than tinder for sure
Ondra Kosik,"Turns out you it seems you have to pay to get to 100% completion, as a male. Now I have seen the UI from female user side, and there are no clear incentives for women to msg first. 'Ladies first'? Is that it? Such a valuation on IPO and that's the revolutionary spin on dating? Also, the swipe UI itself - you need to drag your finger across the whole width of screen to action the swipe. My finger is noticeably tired compared to Tinder - it's way more sensitive there & swipes are faster"
cristina,"Bumble if you want to be a valid alternative to tinder you need to add more political orientation than liberal and conservative in these historical times. Pure left wing and right wing are not represented so they would both choose nothing. It is not a great user experience having to meet each other in a chat, or worse in person."
artistreality,Just tinder that gives women the power to make first contact.
Chris Couture,"I've been on a lot of dating sights and I'll be straight forward, this app seems to be full of people swiping to waste time in this day in age instead of trying to meet an actual match. I'd choose Hinge before Tinder but bumble comes in hard last."
Kshitij Rahatekar,"Bumble is soo much better than Tinder in terms of getting matches, but it has its own glitches. A lot of times I don't get notified about new messages, new messages don't pop up instantly after I open the app, it shows you are offline even when the internet is on. Overall it's a good app."
James Warren,"Poor. No matches, not one. I get about 4 matches a day on other apps. I have paid for spotlight twice and the recommended times and nothing. I have completed everything on my profile but it still says 95%. Would not recommend. People told me tinder was trash but I have loads of matches and conversation there."
Star Lord,"Been using from 3 months still hasn't got any match, worst thn tinder tbh"
Robert Mafara,More dates here than tinder
Shaide Stark,Paywall and unattractive women. Used to be legit but a flurry of landwhales and bad paywall sunk the app. At least tinder gives good eye candy.
Jim life24/7,Not very clear and also just seems pointless like tinder and every other app.
Mark Fisher,It's about what you'd expect. However what made me decide to write this review is that they want you to pay $25 a month to see the people who have liked you. A feature offered for $15 by Tinder (that's also a bonkers price though.) That's absurd.
A Google user,Way better than tinder plus it seems to attract more christain(quality women)
Cody Dziuk,Always broken. Doesn't show my profile to others. Worse than tinder.... Update: same problems as always all they want is money and if you don't pay you won't be shown your matches and your profile won't be shown to others.
Samarth Kar,It's a fake app like tinder.. U just keep swiping and nobody going to msg u.. U can not find any match here.. Every profile of computer generation... Thr ower of the app was working in tinder and they got her fair.. Good decision.. Coz she knows how to play to the emotion.. Don't download it.. Weast of time and emotion. . Please dont send notifications and block us out
Shiva Miller,Worse than tinder
Nassim B.,"Women first, hooooohaaa ! better than tinder, defenitely worth it."
YoshVT,"Horrid matching system, horrible push notifications. Trash app. Just use tinder honestly"
Mr Wasteed,"I hate bumble. Unless you are in a city, save yourself and use something else. Edit1:Additionally, if you look at the profile prompts, it is very ideologically driven questions and default answers. Edit 2:So I joined after 2 years and it still is the worst experience. It seems that this is same as Tinder but as only girls can initiate a convo, guys have even worse experience with it. Idk how a paid account fares but regular is horrible experience."
Kevin Warren,This is garbage you have to pay to see who likes you as a guy? Does it happen for girls? No options to actually select common interests. At least tinder lets you see the majority. What a scam
Zandrah UK Business,"Useless. I have a legitimate phone number from a different country to where I am located. Even though there is a list of other countries to use, the app won't accept it and I choose not to log in with Facebook anywhere. Reply to developer: will they take SIX WEEKS to reply to me too? Don't worry, OKCupid and Tinder worked straight away."
Eliot Sennett,"So when it says ""you reached the end of the line - for today!"" It actually means ""you've reached the end of the line... Ok bye hope you enjoyed yourself"" because it's been two whole days and I haven't been able to get back to finding someone since it gave me that message, and if that weren't already bad enough the paywall is absolutely crazy, like no joke to use the app you need to pay for it, I downloaded this expecting better than tinder but it's WORSE, this app is just plain bad, 1/5"
Robert Clark,This app is stupid. Go download Tinder
Prajay Meshram,They are quiet good profiles in Bumble but they seem fake cause I got no matches using it for past 6months now ...and they want me to pay for unlimited likes . Tinder is better
Mohammad Rahimi,This is better than tinder for sure.
Shivam Bulsara,I bought Bumble Boost. I thought I would get a few superlikes daily for free. It costs 450₹ and no extra features! Tinder offers much more for what it charges you. I want my money back but unfortunately there is no way.
james parle,"Feel like the 24hrs thing is hindering this platform. It's a good concept, but then you see the same girls on tinder who have something along the lines of ""won't message first"" in their bio, so it kinds of defeats them 1) being on bumble where they HAVE to message first 2) only giving them 24hrs to message when the likelihood is they won't in that time frame and the match will disappear"
David Fried,Dating and networking. Talking about opportunities and local value strategies were overwhelming enough for bumble and users that my account was deactivated... so G rated conversations about business and entrepreneurship have a supernano microscopic boundary of what is permitted. This isn't a sex inquiry like how commonplace it is on tinder.... both these apps are now in the category: disgusting.
Robin parker-waters,Alot better than tinder
Brighton Gullquist,I've had some good luck with the app and haven't really found any bots or anything. I considered purchasing a month of premium but instead of buying one from tinder but the price is way too high. So I won't be buying it unless they lower the price
Raveesh Kataria,You guys just removed Bumble's USP. There was never a limit on the swipes. You're just becoming a tinder clone.
Alex Cazares,Tinder banned me so this is my alternative
Jimmy Gursh,Tried THIS app for a 3rd time now and literally no matches. Tinder and Hinge are far better platforms with much more success
Synx,Literally a trashcan version of tinder thats more money hungry. 15 matches in 1 day of tinder. 0 matches in the same amount of time on here
Nipun Gaur,Another app which demands money to boost your profile.Just like tinder nothing special
Uncle Viper,"It like tinder, but yellow"
Ash J,better then the rest specially tinder... 😌😌👌👌
J Davey,"Do you really make people wait exactly 24 hours since their last swipe? I swiped yes on 2 people yesterday, and Am still waiting. Its practically a dead app! Everything pretty much costs. May as well get tinder mate, because you'd have more luck on there than this app. Avoid unless you fancy a bit of disappointment."
KG Thompson,I paid for this service $24 a month and I'm still not getting viewed by the apposite. I know that because I DO get views and likes but only when I use the super boosts which cost even more. It's just a money pit and that's why I will not going 2 renew my account. Your better off just using tinder you will be more successful without paying at all.
Dustin Maslik,"Very integrated and positive atmosphere. Highly recommended for those willing to date and commit to relationships. Move aside tinder, Bumble is the new king of the hill."
Nick Harding,"Harder to get matches than tinder, mainly because the waiting period is longer than 24 hours once you run out of swipes. Very oriented towards paid users, at least if you're male, and even after you pay, they make it hard to match with anyone despite constantly telling you that you have people who liked you."
Diego Rojas Castro,"Almost no IG fishing like most tinder, wish you could apply more filters free but overall good experience"
Vinay Wadhwa,"I used to love this app but slowly it's becoming like all other dating apps. Everything good about it has been now changed to match it with Tinder. Back Swipe, Superlike, 2 advanced filters, Everything is paid now. 😑"
Max Heath,"So many bugs and no means of actually meeting people. I can't put in a description of myself, It says I have likes when I don't, it had to load new profiles and I had to wait 5 minutes. Millions of people in LA and it no means of communication. Yea I'm not paying for this trash. I can't believe I'm saying this, tinder does better,"
Vaishakh,"Most worst app, the app didn't notify me that it's renewing my monthly subscription. And now it has deducted the 450rs, I don't want this subscription anymore please cancel and give back my money. Worst app doesnot match anyone, tinder was better"
Jesse Adams,"It does what it says. I find this to be a better dating app than tinder less bots I hope i didnt just jinx it but there is some typical ""follow me on Ig women "" here. I have no problem with ladies having the first move thing but the whole 24 hours until expire is a down side yes you can extend it but still. Finally bought the $2.99 option because I got tired swiping just to find a match when I click on her it says it's no longer there a bug I guess"
Jason Tippett,"Started using the app after broke up with ex. Used to work great I was able to meet a few people per week or more. I think their app thinks I'm a bot because I've not got one hit in over a month. Have 100+ in tinder - tinder works better. Hinge works better. Facebook dating even works better. Their support team is lackluster at best, send a generic email... Going to delete again I guess, don't want to waste time. Find a way to fix it and I may try again someday"
Kevin Callahan Jr,Bumble is a generically a waste of time unless u plan to pay. Good premise but even if u match and extend most females won't answer first. Matching BFF is no better more ppl looking for same sex dating than being homies. Stick to tinder or PoF or just go out lol
m l,"Worse even than tinder! Playing with peaple lives, and make money from that. It is not a dating app, but a lie, like every other ""dating"" app."
Jahan M,"Great app. But lately most who joined recently dont even fill up full Bio which makes again not safe for women. Definitely, there is option not to swipe. But yeah most depends from users. Its just photos or just name. Dont turn into another Tinder nd use for hook ups please (message for men). Otherwise, its very female friendly nd 1st move from a girl then a man can message."
Emilia Smith,Good way to meet people who are generally very nice and not weird. Met my partner from this and really liked the app. Much better than tinder.
Shaughnessy Flynn,Once youve done your swiping for the day it makes you wait way to long to start again then they only let you swipe like 10 people before you're done for the day again tinder is much better
Philip John,It was good until they charged for using ANY fillets other than location and age. Now no different from Tinder but with fewer people.
Ivan Zero,"2 weeks ...1 match. this is another app .. destiny to die like tinder. only scam, fakes, wannabe model"
Nikky,The best feature about bumble was that I could set advanced filters (like to only show me men who were taller than me). But of course now that's a paid feature now. Might as well just go back to tinder as that's what made bumble stand out the most.
Chris Shawn,"A well laid out app, appearance wise, works smoothly, no hiccups. Now to the actual issues: Way too many inactive profiles being shown, very expensive premium features that aren't worth the price at all, if you don't utilize their premium features at all, they literally hide your matches. Several times I had to pay 2.99 to see 2 matches in my queue that were never shown to me, matches that were less than 15 miles away and my filters are maxed out. Tinder, blk and hinge are much better apps."
Christian Tschoepe,I love it! After 2 years this app has gotten so much better and I highly recommend it over Tinder or Hinge
칼인오조슈아,"Nice app,this is the only dating app that I actually got a match right after joining and able to arrange my first date in 11 yrs.🥺 At least women here won't ghost you,or if they lost interest in u,they will be automatically unmatched removing the clutter in the messages and removing any further hope. And because of that I am considering getting premium,but the premium is a wee bit underwhelming,can you provide free daily super likes of maybe 2-3 instead of 5 per week?, tinder has it at 5 though"
Paul Robinson,"They just changed it so you can't filter any matches, other than by age and distance, unless you pay. No better than Tinder for guys now. Bye bye Bumble."
Lee Clark,Used to be good but over time it's changed to be more and more like Tinder
Rahul Saini,One of the most rubish app. If one is not subscribing any plan app won't even let you know that who is matching with you. I find it useless as tinder.
Luke Lowery,Fun and easy. Definitely find a more relationship oriented crowd on here. Very nice if your tired of the old tinder grind.
Shahood Babar,"If you are actually looking for a relationship or a date try tinder you will have better chance there with fake accounts then on here, either Bumble is not notifying the girls or there are none!"
julian saunders,"good app. I don't think the 24 hours limit for women to message is very good, at first it seems great, but then you realise most women only message because of the limit, not because they really want to meet you. So men end up talking to more time wasters than on Tinder. One improvement I can think of is to make the message box larger when you are writing a long message although it could be a limitation of the operating system"
Theo Georgiev,Way more matches than tinder
Paul Lipschitz,Great approach to a dating app. Seems designed more around getting to know people. Less meat market than tinder.
Joseph Reyes,"Better then tinder, women choose to talk to you cool concept 💡"
Alex Kaiser,Overall good experience on bumble. Better than Tinder with less app crashes and interruptions.
hamed A,"This app made me feel worse about myself. Even after buying boost, It takes me days to get a match. I have so much better luck on tinder than I do here."
Ewen Campbell,Worst dating app out there. Male users cant message their matches (what's the point in matching?) and if they don't message first then they expire after 24 hours. Don't waste your time. Tinder or hinge are better if you actually want to talk to anyone.
Maximiliano Estrada,"Its designed for you to get as few matches as possible, I get 20 times more matches on tinder, sometimes the logarithm is designed for you to get matches only the first day."
MAINAK MITRA,"Amazing, real people!! Recommend over tinder"
MINNESOTA,This App sucks its a run off of Tinder. The CEO sued Tinder thats how she got all her money. She should be sued for copying Tinder. Way to many ADs and ghost fake accounts. Deleted the app.
Awais Bukhari,Far better than tinder
Yash Bhandari,revenge with tinder🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
C Marin,"Its rigged or simply doesn't work, You can swipe,react all you want, and nobody will match doesn't matter how close,far away, cute,ugly, you swipe as long as you don't pay for Boost or Spotlight , you are gonna be matched its just a scam , the friend,connect or date section. And they lie to you at first saying you have a match but just to get you to pay for boost to see your match! I got off tinder because it was somewhat expensive, this just plain scam for paying for boost and spotlight!"
Agatha Parlak,"So far, my favorite dating app. The guys seems to be more genuine. Haven't run into any of the standard scammers plaguing POF and Tinder."
HiveTyrant,Not a very consistant app. And even if you pay it still hinders tinder and hinge do the same gimmicks paying doesn't actually better your chances
Abe Faison,Better than Tinder but not as good as hinge
Vishal CG,Better than Tinder and all other dating apps!!!!
C C,Tinder and Grindr are better
Zeledon 3,"Good tinder alternative in theory, but so much more is locked behind pay walls. It has a more in-depth profile creator and even has ideal covid dating preferences! Overall, a pretty good app!"
Yash Vaja,"Worst experience , why ? 1. They say wait for a day you reached the today's limits ,I wait for 2 days still it's shown the same thing 2. I don't get any match ,I got many matches on tinder but I think on this app most of the profile is fake or paid. 3. Worst experience ever."
Mar Bea,"Not as good as Hinge, but vastly better than Tinder. Same pics got me roughly 10:3:1 ratio of quality matches (Hinge:Bumble:Tinder)"
Isaiah Sanusi,Way better than tinder I love this app it doesn't take forever to match you up 👍👍
Rupert Love,"better than Tinder, but it needs a dark mode to reduce eyestrain for those of us who are neurodiverse (and those who use screens a lot, which is everyone now). Come on, it's 2020. Edit: come on, it's 2021."
It's Ishy,My only complaint is I Wish u could get free coins after a period of time. But hey there is plenty of attractive women on here and haven't seen any fake accounts way better than tinder.
Rado Necodinho,"Edit: they unbanned me. They're better than tinder * * Forcefully logged out. They think I'm under 18 and I'm 23 this app is rubbish. New edit: They unbanned, but I get no matches ever again. Had to delete account. It's useless"
Hashmi Gor,Not great. Most ppl do not reply and it seems to have taken over from Tinder
Alexander,"sellouts. used to have unlimited likes, unlike tinder. Likes limited now. annoyingly I have to wait all day until late at night apparently for me to be able to like again, because they only get reset exactly when they were used up the last day. Great now I have to swipe at night or not swipe for a hole day, or leave some of the contigent for tomorrow an make the reset time be a different hour then somehow ... sellouts ... don't trust them. Selling 5 coins while boost costs 2, so you'll loose 1"
A Google user,"Like Tinder, Bumble has clearly cashed in the trust of their users for short-term revenue. You'll get matches the first 24 hours or so, then never again. If you know anything about psychology, this is the same hook drug dealers use to get you. I hope your stocls get trashed, and your higher-uos lose billions, including their golden parachutes. Maybe after they'll need to work an honest job."
Alex,"It's Tinder in a yellow color scheme where the woman has to contact you first. If you didn't have luck with Tinder, you're not really going to have any luck with this app either."
Paul Roe,"An amazingly better app than tinder and OKC! I've had more real connections in less than a week on bumble than I have in a year on both the others totaled. And so far, no scammers, which neither Tinder nor OKC seem to care about."
DEN LA,Less bots than pof or tinder.
Kimberly Lambert,Bumble is great. I found a lot of very nice men and I even secured a relationship. This app is easy to use and is much better than Tinder. Good luck and happy swiping!
DovasTTV,"Hate this app! The worst I think I ever made even more worse then tinder!! I made three different accounts in the last month and I get banned for nothing at all! These stupid cash cows just take you're money and tey to make you make a new one it's a scam and fake. Most girls on there are bots and never message you, if they do there ugly or fat or have issues. It's pathetic these days apps are all scams and fake. Why do I get banned Its stupid as hell when I do nothing, save you're money!"
Jim Patterson,"HUGE PRIVACY CONCERN: This app now lists where you work (from Facebook) and there's apparently no way to block it! It also sends you nonsense notifications all day long just to get you to login, it's a copy of Tinder with one additional feature."
luca salvador,"Easy to operate, Simple but elegant layout, Several bonus features, Covid friendly, and when you actually use the app as intended you get a few matches every day and thats always a confidence boost. Plus I can't use Tinder."
Ryan McGuinness,"Fun, and tinder is a barren wasteland by comparison."
Keegan Nitsch,Better than tinder
Carl Johnson,"Marginally better than tinder. Ads. Wants me to pay to allow matches to ignore me for another 24 hours. Won't correct the people selecting the wrong sex. Notifications are either late or duplicate. Can't use unless you agree with their political view point. I could go on, but this is all the time I will give them. Oh and the women still won't message first."
Raghav Soni,Difference between Tinder and bumble was that you can't keep swiping on Tinder but you could on bumble but this update really sucks change your name or delete the same
D b,"The app is shite at just working. It constantly takes you offline and doesn't function half the time, while showing you the same people over and over again because when you swiped left on them the app was offline. Atleast tinder can keep itself online. Horrible."
Daniel,"The idea of the app makes sense on paper but in practice it does not work. Well, if you're not hot, this app isn't for you. This app is designed to alienate the ""average joe"" and give the ""hot guy"" the advantage. All dating apps are inherently superficial but this one more so than others. If you are average looking, do not expect to get many matches and if you do get any matches, do expect them to expire. You'll have better luck on Tinder or Hinge if you are looking to connect with someone."
jasmine l,Ban people for being transphobic. Tinder is better anyway. Freedom of choice you agenda based idiots.
Benjamin Mayer,"I don't know where the negative reviews come from. I tried this dating-app and was very happy about it. Better alternative to tinder and I like the method, that girls have to write first. It's really funny!"
Korey Jacque,"""2 people liked you but you have to pay to see it"" *Pays the 1 day* ""Nobody here keep swiping"" Better features then tinder at least"
Kristina Woods,"I literally hate this app. The ""Women Message First"" gimmick is neat, but it ultimately makes it to where you have less people to talk to you if they forget to message you. The UI is ugly and whoever designed it should feel bad. The only reason I still use it is because I'm banned from Tinder"
Avishek Roy Chowdhury,You will definitely be losing a lot of daily users with the stunt you pulled off about the limited swipes. I used bumble more than tinder cuz of the unlimited swipes that it had seems like gotta switch now🤷🏻‍♂️
Stephen Renz,"It's just a copy of Tinder but women make the first move, which means no moves are made lol. I'll stick with Tinder so that I can send messages."
Dylan Lee,"It works but premium is too much, premium is $25/month and all it gives you is unlimited swipes and you can see who liked you THAT'S IT, it does not give you any coins to spend even if it's just one a day (requires 2 coins to super swipe someone) honestly not worth it at all tinder is better but the quality of girls on this app are good and there's rarely any fake accounts"
David Linton,Really very disappointing! After several months of paid sub Tinder and Hinge much better! I did contact and not very helpful at all
Dylan Hood,Way better than tinder
KeepitRazzy,"Pretty good, bj's were better off of tinder tbh"
James Pavez,"It's good, set up an account during lockdown, also with Tinder and POF, Bumble is definitely for people who aren't time wasters, I'd recommend it as a first port of call for people who want to connect. 5 stars from me. Good luck everyone, happy trails!"
Oscar Herrera,"Awful, THE WORST This is a terrible app, I went in expecting something like Tinder easy learn and use - strait forward to use. Its honestly a scam it offers you a one day option of like 2.99 to see who've you matched with. But you have to read the fine print it charges you that like EVERY DAY. I go to Walmart to buy stuff and to my surprise I don't have any money. This app isn't worth it at all."
Active Evolution,"Bumble is turning into tinder *vomit* .. About a year ago this was a app was for civil normal people, now its gross just like tinder. The types of individuals that are on bumble now...Yuck"
Caitlyn Gilchrist,"The app is nice, but I find that when I try to make an account/redownload it, my account gets deleted/I'm blocked from the app. Im open about being a sex worker, but dont use the app to promote or share links. It makes me wonder if that has something to do with it. I always verify my account, and I write a nice bio to introduce myself. At the very bottom, like A LOT of users on there, i'll add my IG. I use the app the same way I use Tinder and I have no problems with that account. Disappointing."
Ashish,TINDER IS BETTER
Q T,"Only used bumble for a few weeks and it is good so far. Gave 4 stars because this app has an interesting history. The Ceo was an executive at tinder... More activities might be good in future as it is basically swipe left or right but I have a feeling ""they"" are workin' on it. 🤔😏😉 I hope this app really takes off this industry needs better apps. 😄👍"
SURAJ KARANJE,This app cares about is making money..i used all premium feature yet I go just 1 match.. on the other hand on Tinder i didn't pay a single buck i got 4 matches in 2 days... Bumble is all about making money..
Selkie,"Really fun. The layout and colors are cheery and cute. Girls have to message first, so that's fun; I get to work on my conversation skills lol. And the prompts make profiles a lot more interesting and gives you more material to work with. Feels a lot less hookup-y than tinder"
Link Link,"Oh let's make an app like tinder, but make it more complicated, more restrictive, and ask for a ton more money. 😒👎👇"
TouchMe Sama,"Once you get a msg from them dont let up, she's already talking to you. Better than tinder."
Darren Eck,"Typical waste of time dating app, same or worse than tinder"
anthony mainini,No matches in 2 weeks. Tinder at least gets a few matches
Raghav Mahajan,no matches and unable to adjust distance....used to be much cooler earlier...now u can only swipe on a limited number of people per day ... tinder is much better ... atleast I'm getting matches there
Antoinella,"Pretty good so far. I wasn't expecting much but I have already found someone I connect with quite a lot and it's only been a few days!!! This app takes away the pressure as a female and you only have to message the people you match with (if YOU CHOOSE to) they will have 24 hours to respond and if they do, you both can text and see where it goes. If not, well there's no harm. It's a little similar like tinder (swipw right to match) but without the reputation for hooking up."
Alpha Zero,"Far better than Tinder Actually let's you add filters to see certain types of people, Actually let's you add new photos to your account, isn't overpriced and most people actually have bios. Still yet to have a strike of good luck and match someone 🤞🏻"
Victoria Church,"There are not many profiles because of their algorithm, compared to tinder for example, there are like 10 times less profiles. The idea of women talking first is great, but beware all the guys on there taking whatever they can get. Easy to find loser guys that just want any female. Also, the people who work for bumble can and will invade your privacy/profile) messaging and meddle in your business. I think it is my least favorite dating app."
D S,"Works well if you dont mind carrying the conversation. Speaking as a single guy, this app gets me more matches than tinder or anything else but I'm always the one carrying the conversation. Maybe that's just cause women are boring and dont usually have to try 🤔"
Adwait kulkarni,Useless app. It's another Tinder with different marketing scheme. I bought 5 coins from its still don't show me that coins. It's scam they are cheating and earning money.
Szabolcs Dauda,"Better than tinder , I LOVE THE FILTERS"
Robert kirk,So far so good.... I like it better than Tinder
Luc Webdevelops,"Way better than tinder or match dot com. I recommend looking for marriage or LTR because of the covid crisis. THE CURRENT CRISIS makes promiscuity a dealbreaker. Its a great app because wombyn decide who they want to meet! I took a star off because I'd rather pay for an app if im currently dating, not if im single. (Profit motivation is Backwards)"
Fakhri Kurniawan,"Cakep2 gan isinya, beda jauh ama tinder"
Hogan Gammons,Much better than Tinder. More likely to find an actual relationship if thats what you're looking for. Less fake profiles as well.
Jerius Flores,Kinda like tinder tbh
Joe Cooper,Girls never message me on the app and given I can't message them the app is good for absolutely nothing. Tinder and hinge work far better
Marcus Mungeam,Same bs as tinder. Waste of time! Not even worth downloading. Uninstalled the next day
ThinMints,"Maybe it's my app, but it dosnt have a 24hr cooldown( like tinder does) before I can swipe again. I think it's been four days now and I still dont have the option to swipe. I just wouldnt recommend this in general if you are patiently waiting around."
Jim Bob,"10x better than tinder, people actually talk!"
dylan klebold,Bad just bad got banned for no reason and thay are all bots just use tinder
Nik Parbhakar,"Did the same thing as Tinder, no more matches for anyone till we pay the application for boast. Bumble was better when it was new. Now its just a all about business. Disappointing."
TheBlukePhenomenon,Couldn't find anyone on the app. Turned out the girl of my dreams was on tinder.
Vsevolod Affliction,"Do not spend your money on this. First of all it will take your money without asking after you already payed for something. Boosts don't work. To compare it to a tinder boost, tinder (15minutes) 15 likes per boost, bumble- 1 like (30 minute boost) And I'm not talking about matches. These are all the people that swiped right."
Benjamin Hall,Great to meet people! It says you can pay $3.99 for a day but a couple weeks later I got charged for all of it. Just found another$2.50 that came out of my account from Bumble... I have NO idea where it came from lol get on here and get off quick (fingers crossed) or try tinder. DON'T give bumble your details
Jake Jones,Don't even worry. Use tinder
Vaibhav Narula,"Used to get really good matches and a lot of them to be honest. The matches just stopped coming after i bought subscription so yeah, going back to tinder. Bumble is not worth your time. 👎"
heathawk noob,"The concept is okay. Compared to Tinder, it's nice in that women have to make the first move. It's happened to me way too often where I get a bunch of matches on Tinder only for them to never want to talk. The issue I tend to see is it is basically the same here you match but they never want to say anything. I'm not sure if it is because women arent aware they need to make the first move or whatever but it ends up being a time waster. But if you are interested in just killing time, then its ok"
Brandon B,"Why can you only change your gender twice? It's such a weird choice. Its like they thought about helping out the LGBTQ community but just decided to say ""screw it, we'll only commit halfway to it"". Other apps like Tinder and OkCupid let you change it however and whenever you want. The Bumble developers need to get with the times"
mragendra chaturvedi,Shows good profiles Better then tinder
Josiah Laturnus,Not receiving any notifications no matter what phone and app notification settings I toggle. Never had this problem before. Much better than Tinder otherwise.
Adam J,"God awful, bring back the old dating app style. Stop being Tinder 2.0"
arsenio smith,"I love the fact that the women has to msg you first. Makes conversing easier when they break the ice. I've met a wonderful woman off of this app and I'm looking forward to spending longevity with her. This app, in my opinion, is waaay better than tinder/match/POF etc... ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ hands down."
Vivek N,Could make few friends.. better from tinder
Siobhan Merle,"*sigh* It's just Tinder masquerading as the safe place for women...at least in LA. Sexual harassment, crotch pictures in messages, predators, and when you report bumble sends a message about ""keeping an eye on"" them. No one's expecting totally safety on an app but for how much effort bumble puts into its marketing as a platform that puts safety first they really don't do anything, it's just a strategy to lure more women onto another unsafe and predatory platform"
Adam Pires,"This is the worst dating app I've used. The idea of letting the woman make the first move is awesome and all, but the app needs to let you swipe and match in the first place to make that happen. App only lets me swipe like once or twice a week unless you upgrade. I get barely any matches and far less on conversation. Right now I have 0 matches to talk to. Better off going with Tinder or Facebook Dating. I've actually been able to match, talk to, and go on dates with women on them."
Connor Potucek,"I love the concept, far fewer fake profiles than other dating apps, but the whole 24 hour expiration thing needs a second thought. I don't want to be on a dating app daily, and I expect the same for any future partner. We don't want a desperate hook up(there's tinder for that), we want connection. I can't connect when I'm backcountry skiing for a couple days and my match expires. We were going to be great, but she was busy, too."
Killian Hotz,"This app is super predatory to its users. The people who like you are locked behind a paywall as they won't show up normally. If your gonna use a dating app, even tinder is better than this pile of flaming trash."
Martin C,Most definitely better than Tinder when it comes to dating but DO NOT put your card on file. Wanted to see if it was worth it and it's not. After cancellation they continue to charge my card with no way to unsubscribe. If you're going to invest money go the Tinder route. They offer more for less money and don't steal from you!
Miss Tania Reid,"They deleted my account and gave me no reason why and never responded to my email! So disappointed. Bumble is no better than Tinder, same thirsty men who will waste women's time if they are looking for a serious relationship."
J Smirk,Better than tinder
Marcio Filho,Horrible app. Treats men like trash. Tinder sucks but that's a paradise compared to this.
Swapneel Deshpande,"Tinder is still better, Atleast i got response on tinder. There is nothing here, not even location specific"
bris fry,Unfortunately bumble is a ghost town now. Most have gone back to tinder. You won't get any notifications a week where back in 2018 I was getting 20 a week
InvalidUsername _,Choose between not accounts and paying for boost to get zero interest from other users. I'm not a bad looking guy and I got more interest on Tinder than Bumble .
Rajan Dodeja,An option fir verified people unlike tinder 😜
William Gomes,"Not worth , Tinder is better."
Shivraj Pranks India,Pathetic app tinder is far better than this app
Will Berb,This app is more friendly and female friendly than scam ridden Tinder. Women make the first move. ❤
Thomas Maegerle,Seem to be more real people here than Tinder. So tired of the bots and scammers there. Still waiting for my first match though.
Alexandra Biggs,"Good, easy to see what people want and filter accordingly. 100% better than tinder."
Artur Tumanov,"Decent experience soo far, but please either remove the notifications for super likes or do the same as tinder where you get 1 super like daily. It's highly annoying to see them pop up and brought to the purchasing screen every time."
Cole Kennedy,Bumble is miles above any other dating app that I have used. It's a thousand times better than Tinder.
Seetaramarao Tv,"I recently installed this app Subscription paid. There were very few matches and most of the messages didn't even progress much. For my surprise today they have blocked me saying someone reported of mis behavior, abuse etc. This is nothing but loot. My dear friends don't trust this app Its day like robbery Fortunately I paid for one month subscription AVOID AVOID, AVOID Tinder is the best"
Carmen,"Free for *All Women* all men must pay for every single added feature. This is just a tinder face-lift with a way to target men by making them pay extra for each and every benefit, and giving this app to women 💯 free and clear of paying 1 cent. Great app for men who love to waste money 💵 *Men pay* **Women never pay** ***Review verified***"
K M,"I paid the $25 for 1 month and I bought credits. Super likes don't work and boosting your profile doesn't work either. I'm pretty sure no one sees my profile. I have over 1k likes on tinder. If I'm lucky, I get about 3 matches a week on bumble. I get the same amount of likes when I wasn't buying the subscription. So, I wont be paying for it anymore."
Yay Yay,Bettet than tinder imo
Caleb Richardson,"Really bad app for men. I matched with a lot of people and received zero messages. Just use tinder, at least you won't be used as an ego boost for people at the expense of your own."
Mind Amazed,"I have amazing pictures for a man of 41, I look about 30. I have a good profile and say I have a sense of humour I am honest and loving. After this I have received only 3 likes and only one girl spoke to me. I am mixed race part Indian and white and very attractive. I am 6ft talk and about to do a PhD. My white friends post one picture, no bio, and they get over 20 matches on bumble and tinder and hinge. Something is wrong here, men are depraved of female attention for no reason."
Jimmy Tran,"Matches never message you. To the developer who leaves these comments about whether or not my profile is good enough, you are putting the onus on me, the guy who can't say anything. Once you match it's not in my court. ""Hi"" is simple, easy and effective. Dating apps have forgotten the reason they're around. And that is, to form genuine connections between people. Instead they've gamified people's loneliness for profit. Not just you guys, but OkCupid and Tinder too. Rework it."
joshua Lewis,No where near as good as tinder
Jane Doe,"Paid boost feature does not work. I've reached out to tech support via email and social media, I don't think tech support exists for this service. Over priced paid boost features that don't give you the premium access that's advertised and no way to fix the issue or receive a refund. Use tinder or hinge or literally any other app before this one. 0/5"
Bhargabh Goswami,Been 2 months. No matches yet. Tinder is giving more matches instead.
INFINITE,This rubbish never works! But believe me it's not U my reader. It's THEY who manage the app and make terrible apps which no longer work. U can find ghosts online but this rubbish is useless. Maybe hire better ppl who can make better policies! My advice: stay away from tinder or bumble as they both seem so dumb. 🤷
Wilfred dsouza,Better than tinder for sure
Jacob Constable,"Best dating app out there tbh. I've used Tinder, POF, & OkCupid, but Bumble is where I met my current partner and we moved in together this spring soo... 👀"
Glenn Hendo,"Rubbish sexist ap. This ap will block you for no reason and won't investigate the matter. Bumble will form the opinion "" you breached the code of coduct"" even if the breach occurs on another ap. Bumble will believe anything the female has to say even if it is not true. Full of fake profiles. Full of crazy women (worse then tinder). Dont pay for anything or you won't be able to cancel it. This ap isn't worth the hassle."
Dehaney Vernon,The replacement for tinder now that they've turneeed into the feds
Cyndi Cox,Better than Tinder 🤣
Cat Smith,Better than tinder
Zach Schistosome,"The fact that it's not: Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, PoF or any other Match Group™ product puts it head and shoulders above its competition. If only to monopoly-bust, this app should be tried first."
Abdul Rafay,Used to be better then tinder but now that they r huge company they r turning into tinder. Which is basically being discriminatory against men and btw in literally all dating apps the ratio of men to women is 9:1 and they know this. So for men u will see they charge u higher and based on ur age and location they will charge u wayyy more. Do ur research and NEVER PAY THESE CORPORATIONS
P N,Better than Tinder.
Abhimanyu Aryan,Much better than tinder 👍
Paul S,"Overall good...but I swipe right on like 10 people and now have to wait 24ish hrs? I'm sorry, are y'all run by the same company that runs Tinder? Disappointing, ready for the bar scene to open so I can actually meet people."
Mr Hooman,"I like the app because of its travel mode feature, now it's gone it's totally the same like tinder.. when will you guys put back the travel mode? Im willing to pay for that."
Pratik Pal,"Much better than Tinder. The girls actually talk after matching. I will give it a 5 once I use it long term after my ""beginner's luck"" wears thin. Update: the beginner's luck wore thin and I found out the hard way that most women don't initiate conversation after matching. Or they may just be bot accounts aimed at tricking some cash out of you. Cheap tricks I must say."
Siptellnet Hollywood Florida,"Bumble create this ""fake match"" is not real, this women never respond. Bumble is making fool of us. Many ""matches"" but ladies never make the move. I will ask for a refund, also, no more profiles in my area 50 miles around. Bumble ran out of profiles, fake profiles, pictures stole from others dating apps. Waste of time. Tinder more reliable, millions of women around the world."
Neim Echsemm,"Positive: People are nicer here than tinder (if your convo last more than two messages) Negative: In the course of three months I had only 8/9 matches, all in the first week. Compared to that I had around a 95 matches on tinder (same amount of time on each app). Convos are usually worse too because of the time limit to send the first messages and the fact that women are forced to send the first one."
Black,"Has a little bit more of quality users than Tinder or similar. It also has different queues for people looking only for friends or business, so in that regard it is pretty solid. However, swiping more than a single queue every 24 hours requires a pricey subscription."
Alon Parag,"Poorly designed app, stay away Bumble is my least used dating app as it simply doesn't display any relevant users. Most of those displayed are at leadtaround 70 km away from my location and there's no distance filter (or any effective one, at least in the free version). Also, in contrary to other apps such as Tinder or OKC, the algorithm doesn't prioritize users that liked you. It doesn't matter if I swipe 50 users consecutively to the right, somehow that like message doesn't becomes a match"
Vela,It's alright. Bit stressful choosing who to talk too but it's atleast a bit more comfortable than tinder for me.
Saptarshi Saha,Better than tinder
Ian S,"Has gone downhill. Trying to make more money, but limiting swipes to 40 and making user wait 24 hours is not even as good as Tinder. No more free daily go back. Everything I preferred about Bumble over Tinder is gone. I would expect this app to go the way of okcupid."
Mason Maguire,"Horrible experience. Easily can place Bumble next to Tinder. Inactive accounts, the milage is wrong. I purchased the monthly subscription, it was not worth it. I'm only seeing 10-20 people tops. Half of them are a lot further then 20 miles. Definitely don't recommend."
Jon Welsh,"Since tinder bans accounts for absolutely no reason, bumble has really taken over as the best dating app."
Jared Jacobson,"Ridiculous pricing, very few swipes per day, very little to do, lots of fake accounts. Same as tinder (so its trash) but females have to message first."
A G,Great better than tinder
note importa,"Made a profile, swiped some pictures and im banned for nothing. Here are a list of apps to avoid, badoo, BLK, bumble, tinder, okcupid. All of these apps will ban you once and then share a ban list with eachother and will not allow you to use any of them."
Josh Spaulding,Used since release and not one match talk about useless I'd rather donate money to charity then waste it on this garbage premium that doesn't work just like tinder
Niko here,Hi really love this app way better than Tinder but ever since the latest recent weekly update this past week I dont get notifications anymore from bumble app if someone matches likes or messages me I have to go into the app manually & will see a message notification on the icon at the bottom corner of the screen please fix this!
akshanu sachdeva,Delhi ncr people should rely more on bumble than on tinder.
Josh Milne,"Always see this app on social media as the best dating app out there, and instead its probably the worst. Been on and off it for about a year, and only ever had 3 matches. But because the girls message 1st, you don't get anything because no girl ever makes the 1st move. It also seems to be that it's just the good looking girls on there, that are out of most lads league, just like Tinder. There's no variety. They're all 10's nothing below, which doesn't make sense for a supposedly top dating app"
Raunak Chitlangia,Design needs to upgrade. Tinder and hinge are competing
Tkenyon,Worse than Tinder for getting no matches....Algorithms heavly depend on how much you spend - Do not expect to match anyone unless you pay as your profile will be hidden. Pointless
Rohan Sharma,"It's too much better than tinder. I'm getting matches way more than I get on tinder. If someone likes you , you get to swipe them right too in just a day or two but tinder is like kismat mai rahi toh swipe karne milega lol."
A Google user,"App has a beautiful ui. Unlimited swiping for free is pretty convenient though the vast majority of the profiles on there are inactive. As advice only swipe on the ""verified"" profiles. More cougars/milfs on here than tinder though. Update, no more unlimited free swiping. I didn't think it was possible but not only are you now paywalled, you get less swipes on here than in tinder. Women also prove that them getting to make the first move amounts to nothing, as their openers are either hi or hey"
Femi Odutola,Just a worse tinder. They hide your matches unless you pay. Usless
Zackary Severino,"While not as full of prostitutes as Tinder, it pushes its paid services too much in notifications."
Ben Baker,"The app is good when it works, just generally feels like a nicer environment than tinder. However I haven't been able to log in for several weeks, left multiple emails and messages and had 0 support. The customer service is non existent"
Dontae Jacque,this app and their moderaters are a complete joke. deleting my photos and sending me warnings for no apparent reason. I actually read the guidelines and I did not violate them in anyway yet I get flagged because some user reported me (probably because I rejected them for being weird). don't waste your time on this app it's completely useless and you're better off downloading tinder or hinge
Alec Dela Losa,Does not compare to Tinder
Paul Cochran,Algorithm seems more fair than Tinder at least.
Jonathan Ungvari,Better than tinder
Sheena Woodward,Downloaded this app thinking I'd get on better with it than tinder. Turns out you can't select wanting to look for men and women! As a bisexual I find this really disappointing. Won't be recommending to anyone unfortunately
3vilameba,"Some matches I get notifications for, some I don't and they ""expire"" before I even see them, even though I check the app everyday and they want you to pay to rematch. Used to be a good app but like others are saying, it's turned into a scam to get you to pay. Just stick with tinder, more people on there anyway."
Saurabh Mishra,It's far better than tinder
Puneet Nagpal,"Why is it so hard for Bumble to showcase one's location correctly. If Tinder, Ola, and Zomato can do it, I am sure your engineers should also be capable enough.. Wrote to your team and got another pre-canned response."
Ordepnok,A lot more comfortable and versatile than other apps you'll find out there. Definitely deserves as much (if not more) popularity as apps like Tinder.
Nitish Balagopal,Very stupid app....not getting matches at all.... Go tinder or happn... Was a bad choice going for premium account
Matthew Little,"Callous and cold-hearted refund policy. I was auto-charged a subscription fee on an inactive account for an additional six-month term. I emailed Bumble within hours to tell them it was an error and they simply sent me a message saying the fee was non-refundable. This is an immoral and unforgiving policy and is telling about how the company operates - dishonestly and without regard for users. Truly, I had better experience with Tinder customer service, which says quite a bit about Bumble."
The Legend,"Edit: After some thinking, I finally gave in and decided to purchase a subscription. Needless to say, I was impressed. Unlike Tinder, Bumble allows you to learn more about people, and to react to their images more diversely. In addition, I've had an easier time, as a guy, engaging in conversations with matches. My subscription is still in effect so I can't say whether or not it's good without it, but so far, my experience with bumble has been collectively better than every dating app I've tried."
Chris Chase,"Its been sitting on ""pay to see more people"" for over a week now. And I hasnt used the app in 6 months and used it for a day. You either are shisty, or your system is turd. Id like it if it wasn't always messed up. GG back to tinder I guess"
Steven Bara,"WARNING!!! They block you without any notice. I suddenly had my valid pictures removed and needed to verify, which I already did. I wasn't able to access my profile anymore even to delete it. So suddenly you do not have any access to your data anymore. This is almost criminal! Don't trust them with your data! 99% of the profiles are scammers anyway. This app should be banned by Google, but as with Tinder, money rules I guess :/"
Michael Cox,Amazing and the best dating app. Really. Get rid of Tinder.
De Medici,"I have been using Tinder for almost 7 years, Bumble is the new 👑 of dating apps."
James Dismore,Great app I am meeting babes. Not as much as Tinder though
روح,No bogus profiles. People with good eduction level (better than Tinder and any other apps i tried)
Colin Spurr,"Just as terrible as anything that the Match Group actually owns which are all Tinder clones now. Almost no matches. Almost no messages. Almost no one meets. When you do meet it is often terrible. Paywalls, paywalls everywhere."
Kyle,"Coming from Chappy App which has now shut down and it kept on promoting Bumble. I am extremely disappointed in this App. Firstly the user interface is buggy, confusing, and simply off putting and lacks the simplicity from apps such as Tinder and Scruff. Really disappointed. Nothing in this app that really stands out. And needs better verification system.."
Melissa Bruno,So far the men on here actually want a relationship not like Tinder...lol
Marco Bissaro,Very good app! While I have the feeling that Tinder is only a self-confidence booster for most girls—hence the scarcity of matches—this actually allowed me to have enjoyable conversations with someone.
Bollywood Songs Cover,Better than tinder
Josephextreme,"Women have the power to initiate, yet they don't and let the match expire because they are already conditioned NOT to initiate. It's just tinder but worse"
gurpreet singh,I have got some matched here on bumble . It's better than tinder I reckon xx
Landon Faulkner,Definitely would NOT recommend this app. Tons of fake profiles/ catfish and lots of onlyfans skanks and scam accounts. And the customer service when having issues is abysmal. Stick to Tinder. Way better
Daniel Gentles,They try to sell you things that look like a one time purchase but actually put you on a subscription that renews every single day. The reciept for these subscriptions then go to your promotions inbox so that you do not get notified. Plus this app is a worse version of hinge and tinder
Ali S.,"Bumble has become a joke, I ran out of swipes yesterday, apparently we have a hundred swipes not even likes just swipes this morning my swipes were replenished I swiped six times and ran out of swipes again and was asked to upgrade LOL what a joke going back to Tinder at least tender gives you certain amount of likes not swipes"
Different videos for fun,Ekis dito at sa tantan at tinder. Nag match nga hindi naman nag cachat o reply hays
Hi There,"I promise, you will be so happy you used this not tinder. Just remember, girls message first (men can't)."
Tymothy Mancini,"It works ok for the most part. I don't like that you cannot change the order of the prompt questions when you add them like you can on Hinge. Seems like a simple enough feature to integrate. This also has the same problem as Tinder, it shows my profile to the opposite sex and vice versa despite me telling it I'm not interested in anything but a heterosexual relationship. That's extremely annoying and misleading to people, please fix that."
Mikaela Novoeslov,"Soy lesbiana y esta app está cool para conocer chicas, mejor que Tinder"
E-Boy,"The photo guidelines are RIDICULOUS. You're not even allowed to post mirror pics or selfies, basically. I even uploaded ones that weren't mirror pics or selfie pics and they were still flagged and removed, even though they broke no guideline violations, and they were still removed. Tf? I had to resort to using random pics I didn't like and hope they stayed up. So, it's useless. Stick to Tinder and Grindr. At least you're allowed to post how you want to look."
Brandon van tonder,"Rather get tinder. This app is so bad.. After discovering how useless it is I tried to delete my account and the app asks you to type ""delete"" to confirm but once I've typed it NOTHING HAPPENS. would rather remain single for the rest of my life"
Nate Cleveland,"How long am I going to be out of ""Daily swipes""? Do they not refresh daily? It says I'm out of them ""....For Today. Upgrade to get more swipes!"" Silly me. Why would I expect a free application to not go for a quick cash grab. Im going back to Tinder!"
Leah Williams,Love this app. This is way better than tinder and I have had a really good experience with it.
Jillian Rowley,100000x better exp than tinder
Akshat,Better than tinder
LogInValid,"Barely any matches and when I did match, they never messaged me. Buncha bull, juat like tinder"
Liv Kupai,Good app. Can't fault the app really. Much better than tinder. Also I love it has an option for audio recordings! Makes it easier to get to know someone.
kÄnsen Media,"The concept is interesting. Gave a try if seeing convos could be better than on Tinder but, apparently you have to be a Greek God or someone plenty of hobbies/experiences in the way the matches you want know the most don't let the 24h countdown die off. I'm sorry but i'll keep Tinder where I can blame my unsuccess with some matches because being silent / not initiating chat instead of being swiped right for then not be enough good for a first message in 24h as happened on this app. Cheers."
Punith Parlesha,Worst app PL. Go for tinder or another
Rose Chisholm,"I can't get laid on Tinder as a woman. The hookers on Tinder report on all the real women as fake. Bumble is much better. The guys are more trusting, too. They are not suspicious like Tinder users."
Joe Chessher,"I find Bumble is flawed if you are a guy using the app, because getting a match is meaningless, as you cannot interact unless the woman messages first and in my experience women messaging first is a rarity. Had I not got banned from Tinder, I wouldn't attempt using Bumble and Bumble is not an app I would recommend for guys. If you're a woman, go ahead, you'll probably love it but if you're a guy, probably isn't the app for you."
Vandal Dennison,"This app charged my card like 15 times for a 1 time purchase, I received no compensation for the error. I would recommend another app like tinder or something because this app is a scam"
Brian Stewart,10x better than tinder. You actually get to meet people.
Jesse Furey,"Gives you matches at the start so you are hooked, then you get absolutely nothing after the first week. Uses your vulnerabilities to make profit and no doubt you will feel unattractive and then you will end up paying for stuff. Same goes for tinder, stay off! Very toxic!"
Michael Villegas,"The app funnels you into paying for the app just like Tinder. You'll never see most of your matches. I had 30+ matches for ever at one point because as I swiped right on EVERY person everyday I never marched with anyone. Until I paid for the ""premium"" that's when I was able to start matching with them. It's ridiculous. I use this as another way to meet people and it'll just funnel you to paying for it."
Erica Richardson.,"It's stupid to have a certain amount of time to talk to someone and if no one responds back then they get deleted or can't message at all. This app is a knock off tinder. I rather pay for tinder premium then have this stupid app. I waited 3 months for someone to write me or respond to me, but on tinder people respond to me right away or message me first. Bumble, be more like tinder."
Eleni Andersen,"WAY better than Tinder. Theres more people looking for something serious, and more intelligent and educated people as well. I love the paradigm of women making the first move as well. Suggestion to developer: add more political identity options, i.e. ""left of liberal"""
Andrei Limberea,"1000x better than even Tinder premium or any other dating app contender! Very customizable with results, matches occur quite often and are basically seemless. Great for shy/introvert men seeking someone."
Héctor BB,"This app is boring and kinda useless. Half of the matches just expire cause they're probably thinking this works like tinder. I keep getting notifications from people who ""like me"" but I have to pay to see them and MAYBE get a chance for them to message me. Your woman empowering is a waste of time."
Pralay Maitra,Better than tinder.
Sudhir Sharma,Much better then tinder!!.
Gabriel Arteaga,Love it way better than tinder
Amy Buer,"In Hamburg: This is the only dating app I've found that has men on it who actually want to go on real dates with me. Found a lot of great men here! In Berlin: I write to 100 men. 8 of them write me back. 1 wants to go on a date with me. It's just way, way too much work... On Tinder, interested (really interested) men can write to me first, saving me from writing 92 useless messages. Berlin has rendered Bumble unusable."
michael flocco,Better than tinder
Will Jones,Have much better luck on tinder or hinge
Kevin Cave,"This is such a scam. They force you to pay to be seen but they don't say that. Such a garbage app. Using both this and tinder, i see the same women on here but only match with them on tinder which means I'm not getting seen on here and i have tested this with friend's accounts. What a scam!"
M P,"A nice and cool app. Close to Tinder, even better regarding the space given to personalize the profile."
craig matthews,"The concept is better than tinder and it use to be better overall a few months ago, but now I only get a MAXIMUM of 3 or 4 people to swipe, IF IM LUCKY."
Takunda Mwinjilo,Love the interface and the different modes you can switch to. Great UI. They almost ruined it by trying to match tinder but it's back to normal now
adam hickman,Prefer it to tinder
James Smith,So much better than Tinder. If you are a genuine guy then this is the site for you!
Ben Vose,"If you just use the free features it's alright, basically just tinder without the bad reputation and the necessity to have the cancer that is a Facebook profile."
Tiffani Almeda,"Super easy, fun to use! More user-friendly than Tinder. I enjoy the filters in a search and profile additions. Would highly recommend."
Divya Rastogi,It's better than tinder!
Chris Mitchell,"Could be a good app, but the women almost never respond in time before the 24 hr timer expires. On the off chance you do get a match AND they respond, you are doomed to receive a ""hey"" opener followed by a few sentences of forced convo and getting ghosted. Matches are much lower chance than Tinder (might have something to do with just the size of the userbase, idk). As a man....save yourself hours of frustration and dont bother with this app."
Jorge Tabasco,"Another app that goes for the easy money than for customer's satisfaction. Likes are hidden behind a paywall, they only give 48 hours for matches to start the conversation and charge to give more hours (strangely, all the matches ""forget"" that they liked you even if they appear as recently active). Hopefully some changes to stay in the app for more than just browsing through the censored beeline but at the current state just stay on Tinder (which is also greedy but at least is easier to chat)"
Dawn windeck,"It's a JOKE, the same day I buy to have 1 month full access, I realized my HUGE mistake, I BEGGED THEM TO DELETE my account after only ONE DAY of use since I couldn't do it myself and yes, I WAS A VERIFIED USER, other point is, I find the way they do things very scummy. Anyway feel free to try it yourself, you might have a different experience, not a pleasant one Tinder never appeared so attractive to my eyes before I tried bumble can't give 0 star App:-10 Customer service:-10 Satisfaction:-10"
Garrad Flint,"I've used tinder & bumble for a while now between GFs. I've never, not even once, had a full conversation on Bumble. It may just the culture where women message first, but 90% of the time I only get a ""Hey"", I reply and conversation over. I would say it's just me, but I've had many dates and chats on Tinder. Update: Now bumble is hiding all matches. Can only see them by paying. So why bother swiping? So the app seems popular to others. Paying does noting anyway, you match then get no response."
Max Gringaus,You don't get anything unless you pay. Tinder CEO was right calling the company owner the way he called her. BUMBLE SUCKS!
Jason Michalko,"This place doesn't have their stuff together, unprofessional l, they block your account for no reason and blame abuse or rude... literally for im guessing a jealous ex or someone I know doesn't like me on the app because they give no explanation or proof even when you have a real clean profile.. waste of money, use tinder much better for the moneys worth and this ridiculous unprofessional bs won't happen..."
Ceus,Way better than Tinder !
Zane Howard,This app sucks compared to tinder
Emma,I actually prefer this over tinder. it offers a lot more options for lgbt instead of random men showing up on my list i get what i asked for ✨ women ✨
Easton Cantwell,Way better than tinder less trolls and what seems like better odds for guys anyway
Arzel Loreno,THIS IS SCAM DONT DOWNLOAD IT Just download meef or tinder
Ayush Ojha,Bumble is best in perspective of what dating preference you have!!! Tinder comes in 2nd position...
MACHINE,Great interface. Lots of local women. Much better then Tinder. I recommend.
Brandon Sander-Cederlof,Just like tinder and its impossible to find someone real on it
Aaron Small,"Better than Tinder. Nowhere near as many scammers, fake accounts and prostitutes."
joey k,I've used this app several times over the years and it's now the worste one out of all of them. I've been on here for about 3 months and got about 5 matches. On the other apps such as tinder and hindge I got way way more. Furthermore I decided to pay and didn't make much of a difference.
Joe,The theory is great. I love the concept. This is an edit of original review. Easy to tell who is real and who is a fake. Though lot of people treat it like tinder and don't fill out bios or any questions. Makes it easy to tell who to skip. Doesn't spam you with too many notifications. I only really give 3 stars because sometimes I don't think it always shows up when new matches are made and people miss out on the chat window.
Ty Jackson,I have had varied success even if I get matched most women don't even responded in 24 hours so the time limit thing is stupid and so is limiting the number of swipes daily its just female centric tinder and it didn't even work well
Carisa Ham,"More classy than tinder, but falls offline often."
Saeid Farzaneh,They ruined the app. Not as good as it used to be anymore. This app used to be miles better than tinder. They totally messed it up w the swipe limit.
Sandor Dugalin,I like the format. Way better than Tinder garbage.
Paul Caridi,"Started off really well, it was basically Tinder for people who are trying to get a relationship. The longer I use the app the worst the experience got; they started taking away free features like back swiping and filters hoping you wouldn't notice and then the new guidelines they created are so broad that they can't consistently apply them to everyone."
dritsy,"Keeps telling me I've ran out of swipes after about 10 likes , that's wen it does work it keeps letting me swipe 3 times then I get a loading screen, wen you do get matches no one ever talks anyway and the timer just runs out , have now deleted the app so pointless I'd rather ha e my 1 day chats on tinder 🤣"
Minhyuk Park,"The app didn't really work, couldn't find a soul mate 😂😭, moving over to tinder 💪"
Ric Cook,So much better than tinder. I am a guy and have had actual responses. Tinder was follow my insta. Here I have been On dates and had fun.
Russell Ray,This is a garbage site; just like tinder. I reported females on both of the sites and then on the next day; my account is banned. I'm a Trump support and I believe that has a reasoning also 😔 they are lame
Jane Enright,This app used to be really good but it's now as bad in both functionality and choice of potential matches as Tinder. Real shame.
daniel rabaioli,Better than tinder
F Smeltz,It seems to be less spam and fake accounts as Tinder. Really have no complaints other than having to pay to Really get the most out of it. If girls are looking for other girls. Its all guys
Noah Johnson,Its just like a less- functional Tinder
Jordan Jones,Better than tinder
Omar Yamil Abraham López,"Excellent performance !!! Much better than Tinder, the app is really fast & nice."
Shravan Arora,"It's good, if you are average looking you'll still get matches, unlike tinder!"
Brian Williams,"Get notification ""you have a match."" Open app to see match. ""To see who likes you, upgrade to beeline now."" Blocked by paywall more expensive than the already outrage cost of tinder (24.99/month bumble, 14.99/month tinder). Yeah na thats a hard pass from me. Gonna go and use a real dating app now."
supriya Kumari,Maximum people there for casual relationship nd only for timepass Its not suitable for geniune person who is looking for meaningful rel... Or for marriage. You can say its Tinder part 2 For Casual stuff /ONS Really bad experience
Emanuele Battaglia,"It's funny how after years of developing and updates i still get the same issues even tho I bought a new phone much more powerful than the old one. Profiles not loading, the app is off-line most of the times and takes an unreasonable amount of time to go back online. Never had such problems with tinder. So i guess the app needs better developers. From 2 to 1 star."
Corey Stonge,"App fails to keep connected to internet constantly. The swiping program is a lot less stable than Tinder. The app constantly asks to be rated cause its desperate and needy. Had zero matches or any potential matches in years. Seems to be a constant complaint. Many more potential matches on Tinder. Would not waste your time, only thing its better at is keeping bots out."
Sean Bishop,"Nooo, how did you let yourself turn into the new tinder? It was so good getting rejected by real people not persons promoting their instagram or sc."
Senada Raines,Doesn't really do what it's supposed to. 2017 Tinder could do Bumble's job better than 2020 Bumble. Avoid this dating app.
Jayjit Das,Sub standard app. No matches or anything. Trying hard to copy tinder still no good.
sudoer tor,"Gave it a go to see if it was any better than tinder. Found in some ways its worse. Tries to convince you to buy premium by pretending you have likes in the beeline then removes them. The swiping system is completely arbitrary, you might get 100 swipes day one and it gives you 8 day 2 on free mode. App will also brag that spotlights were ""A success"" even if you get 0 matches. Basically the same or worse than tinder..."
Roshan Patel,Don't waste your time and definitely don't waste your money. No traffic. Even as a free user I should get likes. I get likes on every dating app except Bumble. Go with Hinge. Much more quality candidates and it's free. I hate tinder and still find more likes and matches on there than Bumble. Read the other reviews. I don't even mind the pay wall but give me something to pay for.
Matthew Gilreath,"Pretty good overall. Plenty of nice people. Most folks shy away from someone with a disability but people are butts like that everywhere. It's better than POF and Tinder, so there is that."
Nikolaus Lulich,Comparable to other leading dating apps. Im a little less hesitant to use Bumble as opposed to Tinder.
primaler rush b,It's very cool girls are way more interesting then tinder. The only issue is there are not that many girls so it can take a day or two to get matches.
A Google user,"Used to like this app more but, as with all these things, part of their business plan is to gradually retard functionality as time goes by. The vindictive nerfing of accounts which have been deleted and recreated, whereby they will hide certain profiles from you and vice versa, is quickly resembling tinder; completely unnecessary and spiteful. On browser you can backtrack for free but on the phone app you can't any more? Strange, as is the inability to remove profile prompts once added."
Robert Fletcher,Its ok tinder is better i think
Armchair Pundit,Better than Tinder
Andrew B,Every single girl I've met on here has some sort of PD. Stick to tinder unless you want to worry about a date breaking down or becoming self destructive after you respectfully tell her after the third date that you just aren't feeling the connection... four different times... This is just the tinder rejects. Beware
Chris Johnson,So far so good much better than Tinder!!
Seren Christ,"Really poor customer service, I changed my phone number and they didn't even try to help me get my account back. They also ""force"" you to accept policies you might not agree with, very sad way of doing cheap politics. On top of that the app doesn't even work properly and there is no web access like Tinder. Really disappointed here"
Sam Gardner,"It took a while, and they definitely didn't advertise my profile much after a month, but I found my wonderful girlfriend on it. The crowd is better than on Tinder"
Darren O'Hanlon,"App has a weird fault where a new conversation is hidden. Support fail to understand this, asking who has disappeared? Don't know guys they haven't appeared yet. Sent screenshots of the fault to get expert advice such as clear cache and reinstall. Aye I'll do that every time i get a match, stick to tinder guys."
Jr Bolinao,Better than tinder
Therese,Worst dating app if you link yoir instagram you get banned also nobody actually wants to date its just like tinder
Tomislav Cuk,Better than tinder
mirna vm,Where are the men's bios??? All gone after the latest update. If I wanted to swipe left and right from just looking at photos I'd be on Tinder.
Peter,Better than Tinder.
David S,Great alternative to tinder
Tim Nash,"From a man's perspective the app attracts a different kind of person because the woman has to message the guy first. This is less brave more hesitant people, which is a real quagmire. Because of the time factor of the match some women just give a wave, no text. So they easily buy themselves some time and for them it's just like tinder anyways. I love that you can send pics unlike tinder. My suggestion for bumble is women have a top 5 so we see a little number so at least we know where we stand."
Ozzy Wambeek,"Everyone that is on tinder is on bumble. The swipe feature doesn't work that well. Plus you're prompted to spend extra money on bumble all the time. No matches since i've been on it over a week. Complete waste of time. It also matched me with people that were over a hour away in weston super mare, and yet on the app it said they were 15-17miles away. Complete joke"
Person Guyerson,"Woah isn't that crazy, the day I get boost I get matched to three really stunning women that then never message me even when I extend the match to 48 hours. Obvious Botting is incredibly obvious, what is with this app and tinder thinking that matching you with a bot that never says anything will get you to stay and pay the super expensive premium membership costs? Bumble and Tinder deserve the lawsuits that will eventually fall into their laps. Giant waste of time but what's new with dating apps"
Ant Guest,Great app if I wanted to date someone in Singapore while living in the UK. Better off sticking with Tinder as you have better success off a free account. Yes I know Tinder has its bots but so does all the other dating apps. I got 22 matches in 24 hours on Tinder yet apps like this and Baboo give you rarely any matches without premium.
Martin S,Tinder girls are much better
Jason Batten,Just becoming more like a yellow Tinder with each update :(
Saran Kakarlapudi,Looks decent and definitely better quality users than on Tinder.
Nene Garlan,"This is the best dating app ever! Even theres a lot of perverts here, its safe than tinder and tantan i will recommend this app to my friends"
RIICHII RR,"Bumble vs Tinder? No comparison. A POSITIVE supportive MEETING PLACE. Good news is women take the lead here. I like the fact that women who I choose to send a like, or super like, Have control to making the first 'move' Likewise they are able to send me a likehowever after I have acknowledged their ' 'like'.. it's STILL in their control"
Ryan C,"A concept that had sincere, good intentions in practice falls short. Most women, on average, still prefer to be approached rather than being required to initiate the conversation. Bumble also has a serious censorship issue as it does not allow pics with firearms or ""bathroom selfies""...how are either of these dangerous?...Tinder is more of a wildcard with regards to profile variability (i.e. is the profile even real, or a scam/bot), but I've still had more success with it than Bumble."
aiden stewart,I've gotten a single match with another person I already matched with on tinder but I like this format better
Nathan Smith,App used to be okay but then they wanted to copy tinder with the whole premium deal and now I can't get 5 swipes before it says I've reached my limit. Also once you hit the limit the apps locked for god knows how long until you get swipes again.
Noah Kowal,"The free version of Tinder is solely designed to crush your soul to get you to buy the premium version. Bumble is a lot better because it makes it so the first girl you see when you open the app is always one who has already liked you, it's pretty great. It probably still sucks if you get no matches but at that point just hit the gym buddy, no app is gonna help you. Plus for whatever reason the girls on Bumble are super into me, I feel like I'm the prettiest girl on prom night."
Shankar Ravikant,Better than Tinder
Alexander Akner,"It's way better than a lot of the other apps like Tinder. Fewer users unless you live in the larger cities, but the experience is overall a way better, a lot more serious regarding meet ups and conversing. A much nicer vibe 💙 The critique would be some of the off push notifications and the ease of access swapping between the BFF-section and the relationship-section."
ayy lmao,"Worst app iv seen , tinder much better"
Drei,Hello! I'm leaving this here for you. Don't waste your money and your time with this app. It's same thing as tinder and all other apps. Full of fake accounts.
Teleken,"I can't believe I didn't download this app sooner! It's amazing. Way better than Tinder. The profile setup is more robust, it has more in-depth filters for getting really picky about who you swipe on, and giving women the burden of making the first move really encourages confidence in them and it's cute. Been smashing hella since I got the app. I recommend it, gentlemen."
John Leonard,How many people do you think wrote bad reviews because they're just salty? It's a nice app. Better than Tinder for sure.
Honey Arthur,Always notifies you that you have a match but that's just to get u in the app and is often not true. I recommend tinder it's way better and does not lie and say u have a match when u dont.
J T,Bumble makes it optional to verify your account! Would guess about 60-70% of the women on here are inactive. It is Tinder except Women have to message you first. It's literally endless swiping. Good luck guys!
Taylord Gainz,"Garbage. This app used to be good, now it's just tinder but worse because it's extremly political and very in your face about it. I was a big fan and advocate until I logged back in today, seriously was my favorite dating app. Literally every advantage this app had over tinder and others is now gone unless you pay (scam). Also I can't post bathroom selfies!?!?!? How else do I take pics of myself??? Wake up bumble, you have become flaming garbage! Will be deleting shortly, keeping tinder."
Ben Young,"This app seems to be a mature option in regards to tinder, although you still will have your fake profile."
David P,Match owns this app and tinder. They ruin the experience to squeeze you for money. Men especially should avoid this app.
Mutu Thompson,"Software is better than tinder, but there aren't as many people on it. Women can't get spammed as much which is nice"
Unethical Productions,"I like the idea of women making the first move but when no one has seen my profile it doesn't matter. I have been on this app at least twice daily since I downloaded it hoping it would work better than tinder but it's been just as disappointing if not more. I just want to find an actual relationship but I have had no likes, idk what's wrong but I've made a pretty good profile and I feel like just because I'm not paying money I don't get noticed. Edit: Lowered rating due to no response."
Khan Wali,I recommend bumble as one of the best dating app even far better then Tinder... Bumble rocks..
L Younger,racist and transphobic. anyone racist can report your profile. im a black transexual. ive been called the n word on this app. ive been called a man on this app. i have even been told to end my own life and bumble did not care once so ever. i am gladly deleting this mess like i did with tinder which engages in the same racist and transphobic spiel. you can have someone call you the N word and have them unmatch you after you read it 🤷 update they did it again racist app do not use PLEASE!🤗
Robb Medved,I made the mistake of paying for a membership for a day just to go through the 50+ women who liked me but never seemed to pop up in my feed. Now that Bumble knows I'm willing to pay they clearly keep all the matches hidden. I can see them accumulating but if the woman likes me first she will never pop up in my feed. Super shady practice. On the plus side it attracts a classier clientele than Tinder so I cling to hope.
Carl Fattal,"Like Tinder, but worse. Very limited selection every 36 hours unless you pay. Female empowerement is a marketing hype, not reality. Most women will expect you to start any meaningful conversation. On the plus side, fewer ads than Tinder."
Joshua Moran,Poorly designed app. The updates have made it even worse. There are much better options for dating apps like hinge or tinder
Elijah S.,No matches whatsoever after the first two weeks. This app is much worse than Tinder in that regard. Other apps work great for me.
Kiko Santos,"This meant to be a bad copy of Tinder but with 2 main differences: No cheeky or showing too much photos and also 24 annoying hours that you can see the real face of majority the ladies in online dating, overwhelmed of matching guys for a boosting ego collection. Helping more to the one gender frustrating the other? Empowering unsecure people to laugh on the opposite gender? Making feel them safer? Bad built up sexist idea that doesn't make sense and is against equality"
to tinder without question. I've been swipping for a few days now and not a 
Nicholas Gordon,Better than tinder
Gianpaolo Castagnetti,"Esta nueva actualización es un ""paso atras"" con respecto a la versión anterior. Sé que quieren tener una interfaz mas parecida a Tinder, pero siento que eso lo convierte más en una copia que en una app única. La antigua interfaz me parecía mil veces más cómoda y mostraba toda la información necesaria. Está nueva interfaz, lamentablemente, no muestra bien algunos datos como: lugar de origen, lugar actual, ubicación, artistas de Spotify (solo muestran dos), entre otras cosas."
Bob Sawyer,"Total waste of time. Among other things, this app will bait you with false notifications about matches and messages. I have received dozens of them which tell me I have new likes and messages, and I log on to find it's just luring me in to spend time on the app. On top of that, the user interface is clunky, they want money for features other apps provide for free, and the user base is extremely limited, and most won't message you after liking. Tinder is absolutely superior."
Hardik Gada,Worst experience.dont pay for this.tinder is better than all. It's a scam
Alexandre Salmi,There seems to be more interesting people here then in tinder. But the premium could be cheaper!
Max Diverse,"Have some issues with not being seen. I know my value and how my profile looks. Since I got boost, the amount of likes I got rapidly decreased. I've bee on 2x today and out of nowhere I got a fair sum of likes in one go. Not sure if this is a bug or the women on bumble find me less attractive than the ones on tinder and/or hinge 😅. A lot of potential in this app. Remove the bugs though."
Chris D,Way better than my experience with Tinder and Zoosk.
Karl C,"Trash, notifications are just click bait 'the spotlight is on, people are looking at you' No, no they aren't. Pay walls for everything, fake accounts, no messages. Trash, don't bother downloading, you have a better chance of boris sorting covid out than actually getting a decent chat on here. Apps rated 3.3 for a reason, go to tinder/hotornot or any other app out there."
tagilala bori,"It deleted my account because I was trying to sell and buy? There was no previous warning to this, I do not know what I tried to sell or buy, honestly no warning before hand to what I tried to sell or buy, just took my account down, which I find very dumb. Tinder and bumble are the same app, no warning to why they take down the account, doesn't tell you what you did wrong, or how you did it, no wonder no one likes bumble"
Craig Short,"It's really no different from any other dating app and offers nothing new. Even if girls are supposed to make the first move the majority of matches will either remove you or ghost you before they even try to get in touch. If you have no luck on Tinder and the like, you won't have luck here."
keshav rustagi,"Tinder should take tips from you, on how to make a decent dating application."
Courtenay C. Stuppy,"IMO, The quality and selection of men is much better than tinder and match. I am not sure about the women. A nice precaution is that women have to initiate communicating so you're not getting inundated with lewd comments and requests. You can also share pictures, but I have a premium account. I'm not sure if that is available on the free account. Happy hunting 😉"
Finn J,"Bumble stole my money. As my subscription was coming to an end, I messaged them a day or two prior and asked them to cancel it and they didn't respond. Then I checked my account the next day and took my money. And I'm got an auto reply saying they'll get back to me in 24-48 hours and nothing since. Save your time and money, go to tinder or match, don't download bumble guys."
Dylan Sapp,Bumble sucks never even got one match. Tinder worked first day. Nuff said
Karol Nidecki,"Big account database, however when you're a guy you just can't write as first. It's kind of cool if you find girls who gonna make first move, however most of them write only ""hi"", very creative... on tinder you get instant unmatch for this :)"
Taiku Bruno,Better than Tinder
K G,"Photo moderation is horrendus won't even accept a clear picture of me. Best to stick with apps like tinder or badoo, it won't even let you upload a picture what a joke for an app like this"
Aaron Nyberg,This app is a shakedown. If I want to see who liked my profile I have to pay like $3 per day? Not even joking when I say it makes Tinder gold look good.
Brennan Mcilroy,Better than tinder 😂
Dhiraj Sonje,Better than Tinder and other dating apps
Jose Maria Franco Gonzalez,Bumble>Tinder. Great app!
Polish_Pickle,Waste of time! They have the same picture profiles on here as they do on tinder but with different names and different locations. Funny both are made by the same co-founder for both. It's nothing but fake profiles maybe 5% are real. So do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. It's sad they take advantage of people actually wanting to find something especially in these days and times.
Jason Fitzpatrick,"Decent app, every girl I matched with opened with ""hey"" so I always had the real opening line anyway. I think this app and tinder are equal to eachother. Hinge was my favorite dating app by far, so check that out if you haven't already (I haven't been paid to say that, I honestly just like it)"
Alex R.,Like tinder but better! Also better if you're not into wasting time on hookups.
Jamal Jones,"Bumble completly beats Tinder on one count; filters. You can swipe as much as indiscriminately as you like without worrying about matching with an undesirable, such as a single mom. Definitely the better app. 👌🏿"
wiremu smith,"Really good experience so far, many matches and very easy to navigate... much better than tinder..."
John Doering,Better then tinder
Daniel Evans,Its much better than tinder
Suraj Kaushik,better than tinder
Nolan Pollard,Nice app woman make the first move/ different than tinder.. Simple fun app to make new friends
Rakesh Rajpurohit,Pathetic app. Tinder is much better. Guys plz don't use it.
Jordan Williams,"Whoever is claiming that there aren't many women on here is either too picky or needs to do some work on their profiles. I much prefer the women on here as opposed to Tinder, PoF, etc. They're typically classier, better looking, and there are far fewer fake profiles. Also, I love how they have to send the first message. If you're looking for more than just a quick fling, this is the app you should be on."
john grant,they are you going to try to trick you into paying just be careful they use a lot of bots and fake people and they want you to be like oh I have four people on my beeline and then you pay the money and they disappear just don't fall for it and in my area you would figure in a city there would be thousands but it's just like the same 300 women it keep recycling it over and over you want a better dating app tinder for sex and I have luck with eHarmony I know you got to pay for it but it's worth
Astronomical Reason,The absolute worst dating app. Try Hinge or Tinder. If you don't want to take my word for it look at the numerous 1 star reviews. I promise anything more than a 2 star review is someone paid by Bumble to do it.
Joseph Harris,Best New dating app since tinder! Legitimate matches with real quality people. Messaging is easy and the overall look and feel of the app works well.
Megan Chism,"Better than tinder in my opinion. I think it works better and nicer layout, it gives you the option to have more detail in your bio without having to actually write anything. I like that the girl has to message first and if the guy is genuine, they have to reply before 24 hours is up, you can extend that time and it can sometimes gives you the option to rematch if the guy didn't reply before the time expired. You have more options if you do want to buy the premium service."
Steven Christopher,No distance setting and non-intuitive interface. I'll stick with tinder.
John T,This app is trash. They make you pay 180 a year to see matches. Insane!! Don't download this junk better off with tinder or Facebook dating 110% Dont download this app trust me
Jacob Delano,"I agree with other reviews the paywall is lame. Also it feels like Tinder with the swiping. I like that Hinge allows you to message people right away. Go download Hinge, forget Bumble."
Jo You Know,I do not like the updated style of viewing profiles. At least you're not wasting your time for more than a day or two with attractive people collecting dust.... like on Tinder...
Ymani Efunyale,Better than Tinder
Jasmine ferguson,This is definitely better than Tinder!! 10/10
John Doe,"It works but at the beginning all do I suppose, is kinda like Tinder but maybe a little less casual"
Jacob Ore,Its the best dating you will find anywhere sure there is a subscription but to be frank with you just swip on everyone then look at the bios of the people who like you back its the best app for finding any sort of serious relationship 10x better then tinder
Yoshira Armstrong,"Bumble acts like the principal of a high school. Cant have selfies in front of a mirror, they'll take it down. God forbid you put a LINK to your onlyfans or youre automatically blocked. Choose tinder!!!"
Hello Laxmi,Better than tinder .
Joel,Tinder is better.
Jarrett Henderson,"Cash grab, the one thing that made y'all better than tinder you go and take that away smh *September 2020 still terrible swiped on 10 people and suddenly I'm out of swipes I'll stick to meeting women the regular way"
hamish S,"Just rating it 5 so more people join. Jk, it's also way better than tinder and deserves 5 stars"
529_TYCS Manav Mehta,"Really boring if you ask me! After swiping so much an wasting 2days you really don't get any matches! I have used tinder and I get matched pretty easily Also if some does match you on Bumble, the algorithm just doesn't show them to you! They keep asking you to pay for premium service if you want a better experience but so far it hasn't been good Not worth the efforts!"
Arjay Javellana,This is a legit scam.. you have to pay in order to see who likes you too.. total waste of time.. much worst than tinder... Dont install.. money making app...
Mark Holloway,Price and Features make this the best dating app. Tinder is Walmart. Bumble is Target.
Nicholas Taylor,"I'd almost call this app a scam. Hugely money grabbing, pay to upgrade you best believe there's something still restricted and wants more cash to be unlocked. Holds back loads of likes with a paywall. Honestly don't waste your time, you'd be better off with tinder, you will certainly get to see more likes and have more matches."
M E,Much more matches on tinder
Cameron Norris,"This app used to be ok, but recent changes have made the experience just as bad as Tinder. Bring back having 3 backtracks a day and bring back the less limiting number of swipes. I've gone on a date with one person from this app, but in general absolutely nothing happens. I get maybe 1 match every week or 2, and most matches I get never say anything. The engagement here is probably better than Tinder, but the fact they've actively made the app worse as a cash grab merits this review."
David Alexander,"I think the central premise of this app needs some rethinking. I'm all for points of difference, but not when they force men and women to act contrary to their natural instincts. Thanks Bumble for replying. I'm not on social media. If I were you, to increase market share in smaller countries (where Tinder is dominant), I'd adopt a more flexible approach. Perhaps offer well crafted canned openers for women, or give women the option to select specific guys that they can permit to message first."
mike,This is a poor man's tinder
John Lemon,Better than tinder :^)
Mike V,"For some perspective, I've had my profile reviewed a number of times and have been told it's a great profile with attractive photos of an attractive person. Even with having a premium account and using spotlight and swiping for the full 30 minutes, I get about a 10th the matches on Bumble that I get on Tinder. As a guy, Bumble is pretty awful, regardless of how attractive you are. Tip: if you use Bumble, don't waste your money on anything in the app. They are 100% not worth it."
Connor Henrichs,Hinge>bumble>tinder
Cw5110,"Used to be good but.... Like any other app they are good at first, then once their popularity goes up. Then they want to charge you for everything. 9-21-2020: In response to bumble response. It's not a matter of what's free, but what bumble used too be. I remember you gave a user 50 swipes a day, now it's down to 20. Also I shouldn't have to swipe threw 5 people just to get match at the 6th swipe. If someone swipes right just cut to the chase. You guys are becoming way more like tinder."
Bishal Das,Just a beautiful pile of garbage. Tried to imitate Tinder but couldn't achieve even half of it. All you'll see are money-making tricks and tactics cleverly set up and designed by the developers to loot the users while they just sit all day with their lazy butt. I have a question for all the users out there. Did you even meet and get to marry somebody through this app? Or are you just out there wasting your hard earned money so as to satisfy your sadistic souls. One mid-finger is not enough
Abdul Rahman,Better than tinder!
J Chandler,"A far cry from how the app started out. Less emphasis on bio, more on pictures. The new prompts, UI/layout & simplified stat details seem more Tinder-esque which likely means a shift in the demographic they're aiming for."
Melissa Wood,Better than tinder!
Vedansh Chauhan,"I really love Bumble. It's such a straight forward, yet comprehensive app having such a simple interface. It definitely has a much friendlier UI than Tinder etc. . Please developers, never mess with the app UI. It's perfect. Dark mode is all I'm waiting for."
epic creeper,"This really just feels like tinder, but with extra steps. Not very many matches. I do like the filters and they do seem to work. Though at the end of it, it just feels and looks like tinder but with asking questions and who swiped right first"
Matthew Hueffmeier,Bumble is good I like the format and it's a good app. Somewhat similar to tinder. And easy to use.
Remstar sez so,You need a countdown to show when you can swipe like tinder does
Katherine K,"Removed free features, so bummed no more free backtracking, Bumble is slowly turning into dreaded Tinder. Also the newest update makes the profile way too hard to see, busy, info spread out... delete the update and bring back backtrack!!!"
Daniel Pérez,"My first day I got 3 matches. 1 said hi and never replied again, the other 2 never talked to me. Then 0 matches in like 3 weeks. Funny thing is the notifications saying I miss 100% of my matches, even after testing it and swiping right at 100% of the girls. So yeah it hides your profile and the trolls you with notification. Same problem as Tinder, what is my incentive to pay Premium if this is my initial experience ? Even without paying, it's a waste of time."
Hanan Khan,"Waste of money app.used spotlight,didn't got a single match,when u use tinder boost or spotlight u get around 20 matches atleast."
Roger Cameron,"Best dating app on the market currently. Tinder microtransacts everyone just to be seen. But, girls don't like boys -- girls like cars and money."
James Hodgson,"Ight so the matching is rigged and I can prove it some girl with loads of pink in her profile swiped right on me so ive only been swiping right on pink colored photos and used up all my likes 4 times in a row but am yet to match with her or anyone for that matter, meaning just because yoy swiped right on someone doesn't mean they will even get the chance to swipe right on you...no wonder tinder kicks this apps ass all day long"
Bullit Magnet,"Essentially a complete rip off of tinder only worse, pay to play disaster"
Mark Andresen,best dating app. not 5 stars because you can no longer scroll through profile pics in the same way. Changed to 2 stars as they just imposed a daily limit for mon-paying members. Back to tinder.
Umang Malhotra,No matches for boysm This another Tinder like app also sucks for guys.
vinay E,Very difficult to get matches I suggest you don't subscribe you will 100% weast your money most of the profiles are fake and the one option I hate most is we need to wait till the girl response I suggest tinder is the best app
Kanny boy,"It's pretty good, better than tinder you have genuine good people over here, you do get matches on a weekly basis, the premium is cheaper than tinder if you wanna compare sure.. We have verified users that's good I enjoy this app a lot, interacting with new people, meeting up, do whatever you want it's possible. So update (15th September 2020) Met a few good people, Fwb exist thank you lol, mostly girls are looking for a relationship thanks to this quarantine"
ANUBHAV KUMAR,Best app and much better then tinder
Reese Avino,This app really put me in my place. On tinder I have over 100 matches but this app made me put my height. So needless to say I got maybe 5 matches that actually messaged me😂 I appreciate the brutal honesty
Natalie Nugent,"I personally think this app is bs, because they deleted my account as fake and said I've been reported. Not even giving me a chance to prove I'm real or make a new one! So now I can never use this app when I am very real. I wasn't swearing or being sexual on my profile. Obv someone reported me for whatever reason they saw fit, but I think that's pretty ridiculous that I can NEVER make an account again. On facebook you lose it for a day or so. I've never had this happen. Tinder or hinge for me."
Rahul Gurnani,The app used to be a gem coz people actually had to read the bios coz they there embedded in between the photos Now it's just another tinder where photos matter and bio and everything else is placed at the last YOUR UI SUCKS
Victor Rodriguez,"The app's a lot like Tinder, in that you have a terrible chance of getting matches. To increase your chances, it also seems like you have to buy some micro-transactions. It's really a waste of time."
Null Nada,"BFF Needs updating! ""BFF"" is not sex-orientation based as Bumble believes. I only get male matches with the majority being gay. Additionally & by location, outdoorsy gay men are common here so a filter on sexuality is recommended. I prefer straight males to increase chances of finding outdoorsy dudes. Also, no date time stamp like Tinder. I would like to know when the message was sent so I can properly respond. BFF Could be Awesome if these 3 upgrades are added."
Tom Heaton,"Like Tinder but worse, plus a constant stream of garbage articles"
Y'all Need Jesus,"Requires you accept their political dogma in order to even download the app and then the app just sucks. It's a cheap knock off of tinder but with girl power and let me tell you, hoes think they're too good to message first so making an entire app premise based on making guys grovel to snobby hoes is an inherently flawed concept. They're all ugly and hate you if you don't vote for a racist old white guy who only chose a half Indian half Jamaican to run with to appeal to race baiters."
James Epler,I pay for this app. The ONLY dating app I play for. Yet I get zero matches. I'm no way near ugly and my profile is good. Do you even show my Profile? Its ridiculous I can't get a match here but can on others for free like tinder and Facebook
Savage Investor,"This app was a pretty draining and demoralizing experience to say the least. You have to pay for all the basic features, matches are mediocre at best or just women looking for validation. Between this app and Tinder you are watching a race to the lowest rating and right now bumble is winning. Like all washout apps they start off awesome then cave to greed by forcing you to pay because they secretly shadow ban you. Stay away."
Nicoli Ames,"Notifications for new messages are inconsistent, which causes me to unintentionally ignore people. Also, the main message window (where it shows all people that you are messaging) is often out of sync with the messages (shows I have unread when I don't, or shows I have nothing new when I do!). I like the service better than Tinder, but Tinder seems to be better software behind the scenes."
Michael J,"Bumble used to be decent when it first launched but has become unusable now. You have to pay for EVERYTHING. Want to make more than 10 swipes per day? That will be 3.99 please. The app doesn't seem to work most of the time and only refreshes messages at seemingly random intervals even though you have a new message notification. Also profile verification seems to be a joke since I have come across several ""verified"" profiles which are obvious catfishes. Honestly, stick with tinder."
Mike Verhoeven,"Grandioos concept. Na dating apps als Tinder waar veeleisende dames zitten die van alles verwachten vanuit de mannen en zelf niets doen, is een app waar de dames de eerste stap moeten zetten een hepe verfrissing. Jammer dat diezelfde dames van Tinder e.d. ook hierheen komen en dan vervolgens na een match helemaal niets zeggen."
Josh Maddren,I would say this is as good or better than tinder is to use and don't as many fake accounts as tinder does lamo 🤦‍♂️ that's my honest opinion
Louis Reid,I been using this app for 2 months I've had 2 matches in a month I've made 2 accounts all with the same results I've took advices I 1000000% prefer tinder this app complete con
Nathan Smith,Not bad tbf better than tinder
jessica spattz,"Honestly it's just not great. Very limited for what you can do. Tinder is reasonably priced but this app charges 4$ a day to see who likes you. Very strict on what pictures you can include. No mirror selfies?? Took down a couple that were just normal pictures as well. Also women HAVE to say the first thing, and the guy has 24 hours to respond or the match is deleted. Just a lot of stress for no reason?? There are a few good things about the about it but would not recommend."
V L,"Installed as people say its ""less fake"" then tinder. But couldn't get a chance to find out. after putting a few pictures up and doing the profile, the app fails to let me swipe or do anything. It kept saying unable to connect check your connection. Restarted phone and tried turning off wi fi. Nada! Deleted and uninstalled. Galaxy Note9"
Matt Savin,"way better than tinder, double thumbs!!"
Fernando Javier González Briones,Mejor que Tinder por mucho... Excelente UI/UX
Kristine Latham,"Awesome app for more 'non mainstream' guys and gals. Gay and Bi friendly, anti racist, cool amount of info and easy to use! I started using it for new friends and then tried the dating part too. Much better than tinder, pof etc. Only thing I would change is able to see who's liked you first without paying. Just takes longer to get a match, and the price is expensive! But other than that. Top app."
Big Bam Games,Its just an off brand of tinder. Also for how low this app is rated its kinda really annoying seeing the damn ads all the time
Peter Crumley,I have met people in the flesh. Way better than tinder.
Kamatoka,Hate The New Update! Its now so much harder to use and navigate. Bumble is now copying Tinder with the click to the side to get to next photo. Profiles flowed much better when you could scroll UP and DOWN a profile and made it unique as well which is why Bumble use to be my preferred option. Now its hard to see people's information and stats. Can no longer see starsigns either. Bring back the old layout Bumble. Don't fix what isn't broken!!
Cosmic Vagrant,A million times better than Tinder
Jeff,The new format of this app (android phone) is terrible. Each version keeps getting worse. Neither push nor email notifications working. The Tinder format is so much better. Now there seems to be much lower numbers of users.
Caden,Significantly better than all the other apps. It has as much users as tinder and there are more people looking for real relationships.
Dave Beverley,Now lower rated then Tinder. Tells you everything you need to know in the direction this app has gone. Used to be great. Had a never ending stream of likes/matches on an account last year. Now it can be days without my profile being shown to a single person.
Celine Hadrysiak,"Works a bit better than Tinder I like the new prompts feature too, helps write a better profile 👍"
Mark From tinder,Oh man. The hypergamy is real
Andrew Bullard,"Takes a min to get started, but the matches I've had were much better at conversation then tinder lol"
Emerson Smith,Bumble is going down hill. I applaud it for being different from Tinder by making women start conversations but all its proven is that women are bad at starting conversations. Multiple features that used to be free now cost money (and a lot of money too). And just because women message first doesnt mean that your matches will be any more successful. There needs to be an unmatch because I was ghosted feature.
logan68k,"Horrible, god-awful app. Haven't had a match in months. I used to think this was better then Tinder... and for a while it was. Now they both suck. Dating apps don't care about you. They care about money. They don't even try to hide it anymore. Use it for a few weeks while they give you a new user boost. After that? Uninstall it and don't waste your time..."
Joy Kunjappu,Scroll down was a great way to differentiate Bumble fom tinder. Now it just seems like a tinder clone with a gimmick. Also why have you removed the feature of indicating whether or not you want / have children? I really liked that feature because It's important to know but an awkward thing to ask. Might just uninstall this soon.
Rebecca Leijen,"Ive always liked this app but i dont like the new layout. Its a bit awkward to use and its like the Tinder layout. Bumble isnt Tinder, Bumble is unique and it was nice to be different from Tinder. 😕"
Ryan Sonder,"Tinder, but worse"
Kale,"Customer support is a polite brick wall. They may remove a photo weather or not it breaks the rules, and no amount of explaining why they're wrong, will change their flawed viewpoint. Their photo policy needs to be updated to be more precise in what they consider against their policy. Tinder doesn't treat me like this."
CreanBean,So i can no longer swipe. Says i reached my limit. I know tinder has a timer til you can start swiping again but bumble says I'm done entirely.
Alextremmetal,"I hope you like the number 0 cause it's how many match your gonna get with this app, no jokes. 😂 Over 9 month I got 4 match, only once a girl talked to me! Meanwhile I got 50 match on Tinder and a couples of dates."
Johnny Smith,"It's just like tinder. If the app deems you as unattractive, or if you don't pay for membership, then you're essentially hidden from popping up on other user's feed."
Josiah Emhof,Just get tinder. Its better in every conceivable way.
David Kay,This app has slowly reverted back to being bad. It only worked the first day I installed it and let me swipe once in 24 hours where as tinder does that twice. It's not worth using because it wouldn't work or show you anything. You're better off using Hinge instead
Matt Mixen,Would be higher but you only get around 30-50 likes (Haven't actually counted) to use every 2 days? Can't even use it everyday without paying. At least tinder has everyday free usage.
nekochi,"I just don't see the difference between this and any other dating app.yes there is a function to video call and voice call but no one is interested in it as far as I can tell,everyone prefer to text which makes this app just like tinder. I have a lot of matches but none that will Video call or voice call so that makes me wonder whats the point to all dating apps..And I am sure in a few months some will come up with another strategy for a new dating app which will basically give the same result ."
Cristian L,It's easier to get a match on Tinder. I think that's enough said.
Pierrick Bourgeat,"The ""want/have children"" filter was the one feature that really made Bumble stand out compared to Tinder, as this is quite important when looking for a future partner. Now that this feature is gone, with no warning or reasons given, I don't see any reasons to keep using it."
Kory Glover,"Downloaded Bumble, Tinder and Hinge at the same time a couple weeks ago. Since then: Tinder (9 matches), Hinge (8 matches & 2 likes) and Bumble... absolutely nothing. Literally the worst dating app available. Do not waste your time. Anything else is better"
Alex Martinez,"Used to be a better app than Tinder. But now it seems they want to be Tinder by limiting the amount of swipes you have so you can pay. I get it, it's business. But most business with this train of thought tend to fail. I think it is going in that direction."
Raghavi Bala,Way better than tinder.
Han Zhang,"Impractical rules, poor execution. App gets less matches and of lower quality (less common interests) than other apps like tinder and OKC. Does not allow certain personality types to express themselves due to ridiculous rules such as no pictures of anything that looks like a gun. (I build gadgets and some of them launch things. Presumably laser tag guns and even paint guns are not allowed, despite both being very legit, non-violent, fun hobbies.) Would not recommend in general."
Calogero Damanti,"Much better than Tinder, way easier to meet people with similar expectations thanks to more in depth profiles."
Jesse Morrell,Better than Tinder
Rodrigo Costa,"The competition has gotten real vs Tinder, you've ruined the app 😂 your're actually more expensive than Tinder and considering they've copied some of your functions which renders this app now kind of useless and Tinders price although expensive but they are more reasonable than yours."
taylor hodges,"Why do I have to pay? I haven't been able to have a conversation with not even 1 person in the last week because everytime the app says I have a match or someone wants to message me and I inquire, it tells me I need to update to boost!!?? Why can't I met people for free? That's why tinder is more popular. Just wish they had a friends section"
Naquib Nor,"The main reason i prefer bumble to tinder is because i can filter out the zodiac sign. After the new update it seems that this feature was deleted. Please bring it back, it means more to the users than you think."
Wyatt Farrar,This is by far the best dating app I've used. It's better than Tinder and Hinge imo
JuliánOb Oquendo,"Es chida, al menos más activa que tinder"
Mobile app reviews,so a whole month in and it's just the same as tinder it just wants you money only matches with ppl if you don't pay untill you do
Jacob Miller,I've had a lot of good experiences from this app. Generally more mentally mature and confident users. The systems that differentiate it from Tinder are really worth while. Would like read receipts.
John Gunner,"Echt tolle App, finde sie besser als Tinder. Das Konzept lockt auch sehr viele authentische Frauen an."
Aaron G,This app has a personality and I like its personality. Also people on here are more attractive than hinge more interesting than tinder. Love you bumble :) ... wish I didn't know you so well tho tbh
Edward Foreman,"Haven't found anyone yet ; however, it seem like a great advance dating and friendship app. Better then tinder. Get use swiping because your going to be swiping a lot"
Ben Hecht,"This app USED to be a good alternative to Tinder. It didn't require you to pay and was a fresh idea to dating apps. Now it's EXACTLY like Tinder in that you need to pay to get anything out of it. It'll make you wait an entire day after you run out of matches, and then only let you swipe on a handful of people before stopping you again."
jazzy,"The app is pretty good, better then tinder that's for sure I just wish you could add videos of yourself and I wish you could do the super like thing for free every so often or the secret admirer thing but over all having a great experience get to actually have a conversation with people instead of matching and we never speak again or only wanting hookups etc"
Joy Greenburg,Worst of the dating apps. 24 hours for contact is stupid. Selection isn't as good as tinder. Save yourself the time.
Nisim Simsolo,"So now we need to pay in order to ""see the bee who's already liked me in my Beeline""? Are you for real? maybe you want me to pay also for being able to swipe? while OKCupid and Tinder are more greddy than ever, you can be more friendly by reducing paywalls (and not adding new ones) and help us to find match during COVID19 time."
Dennis Tyler-St Clair,Not very friendly for LGBT guys. Had this app for a whole month and not one match. With Tinder I get a new match or two every week. Tinder is much better for LGBT guys
Evan Borzy,"Online dating apps have become pointless. They all used to be good, but popularity always ruins them. This app went the same route as tinder and it's not worth your time. Dont download, dont pay them."
Nicholas Sarabia,"Better than tinder, and more categorized to what you may be looking for...way less Scammers and ghost profiles"
Drew Young,"Subtle thievery. These guys will take your money unless you cancel the subscription 3 times and will not lift a finger to help you. Just talk to someone irl or use tinder this app is hopeless. Edit: Don't worry I did contact support and they told me that NOTHING could be done, don't let these guys get away with lying and pretending to help."
Yehuda Goldberg,"I can affirmatively say that after a few months of using this app and being matched up with people that mever message you, that this app is trash and just like every other useless app. AKA tinder. Point is. Don't get it. Dont waste your time on just a bunch of teases and non serious girls. Edit: I messaged you guys on FB and was sent to the four corners of earth. (In short don't use this app)."
Hertsel Vainer,New update makes this a wannabe tinder app. What was the point in that? No one reads the profile anymore.
Derrick Couch,"This is tinder basically, you might as well sign up for tinder because it just has the same old stuff such as the swipes and misconception of matching with matches that are blurred out( matches aren't free to see). Matches are not the same as potential matches 😑"
sora bowers,"Barely funtional cash-grab made by crew from tinder who wanted more money from desperate men. Half the profiles are bots or inactive and most real women never initiate a conversation, dont bother."
alex,its ironic how bumble was founded by an ex tinder exec that left because of harassment. and its just turning into tinder except its actually worse 🤣
nathan blackett,It can be rough from the guys end but just don't be a sleeze and you should be alright this isn't tinder and not all but most of the ladies on here are because they're sick of the sleeze end of tinder or other likewise apps and just want the chance to talk to humans not idiots.
James Napier,"Its like tinder but the girl has to text first, but yet people treat it like tinder, so the guy is supposed to text first. The app very clearly doesn't make it obvious that the hirl has to text first, of the many matches Ive gotten none actually sent anything, and my experience with Tinder shows that girls want the guy to text first, its a good idea, just nobody seems to actually want to go through with it"
Sara G,"Terrible after updates. Can't have the option to swipe back 3 times, I'm offline all the time and doesn't show me many options after few photos passed. USED TO BE GOOD now is just an average app like tinder"
Shahzeb Atiq,"A complete dating experience. Profile verification, interests, insta and spotify integration, good for women, a COMPLETE messaging experience in and of itself with call and video call available. Bumble is the tinder I wish I had when starting dating."
unloosedsage gaming,"This app used to be good which is why I'm giving it 2 starts instead of 1(used to be 5 stars from me). The concept is clever with the gimmick being that girls hit you up first witch is pretty intresting since that's a rarity on other site's but the app went down hill fast, trying to be tinder 2.0 with the added limit to the amount of swipes you get per day, and having a pay wall at everything you want to do like viewing your likes and get in the ""spotlight"" for more views."
Diego Villagran,"I just deducted a star because it was a promising app, but is going in the wrong direction trying to look like Tinder...now you can't focus on pics, which was a nice feature in previous versions."
Elliot Koh,Better than Tinder. More engaging it feels. Doesn't have buggy issues Tinder had. More informative profiles and cleaner UI.
Josh M,"Garbage app, garbage company. EDIT: since they got their panties in a bunch over my review (no hard feelings, that's just what you're paid for isn't it?), I'll explain exactly why. Bumble exploits addiction behavior like many apps. They have not advanced as far as Tinder when it comes to that. But the really damning thing is the negative impact it has on gender relations, the dehumanizing, objectifying meat market nature of swiping. Woke marketing wont change that. EDIT: lol struck a nerve"
Stephen Pacheco,"So I've used Tinder, Hinge and Bumble and out of the three Bumble is by far the worse. I love the concept that girls get to message first and there's prompts you get to write down but i never get matches. I'm lucky if I maybe get a match a week which is uncommon compared to other dating apps. Also the pricing for premium is outrages compared to other apps. Honestly I recommend Hinge over Bumble. I've had had much better experience with it."
Edgar Cabrales,"App is rigged. Bot matches. Yes it's free to use, but the bot matches are for you to just buy the options and get no where with it once you look at your matches. . . UPDATE: Now it's a 1 star. They officially got rid of the one free feature that was good and that was the backtrack option. Now they want to charge you like Tinder does. I was done with Tinder due to that. UPDATE....No you won't."
Sparsh Raj Singh,better then tinder but u'll never find a match
Gerard Ryan,"Way more intuitive interface than tinder and the quick info tags are good. Though I'm not sure the ""ladies go first"" feature works in the apps favor as there doesn't seem to be many ""ladies"" on this app."
zee nkosi,Way better than Tinder.
Blair Miller,Overall great app. But the team at bumble needs to give users more writing apace. Those short questions are great idea. Either way bumble or tinder i have slim to no chance.
Daniel Regna,Terrible. The people who actually like you never show up in potential matches. I've been sitting on 4 people who've liked me for 8 months now and they've never come up on my feed. Also people who do use bumble legitimately never use it for it's intended purpose... to find real love. Im not looking for a more exclusive bone fest. I refuse to put up with it any more. Either do what your meant to do or stop existing. Not to mention that the premium prices are more expensive than TINDER. Do not get
Suelen Tu,"The last two updates are worst business decision ever, who thought it would be a good idea to turn it into a tinder and hide how many km the person is far away from the user? Put someone who actually knows UX design in the team"
Ray Big,"I really used to like this app till the recent update. As a guy, the conversations I had with women were amazing. People actually read your profile. Right now, this has become a very similar experience to Tinder. Where I used to get profound first texts, I know get 'hey' all the time because no one reads your profile anymore, and I can't be bother to answer. Changing it back would be a win. This way you set yourself apart from Tinder. Quality over quantity. This will grow."
Griffin Glick,"This app is a joke haha, It used to be really good but they are trying to be too much like hinge or tinder. You get like 50 likes a day which is nothing. Your likes are blurred out until you swipe left or right on them but if you leave the range that would make it so that you would potentially match with them the blur doesn't go away.... Ever. So it's super irritating. They will try to make you pay for something every five minutes. This is the greediest app ever with no results"
Graham Kree,I didn't think any app could be worse than Tinder. Enter Bumble.
Charl3z Grant,"Another dating app crushing down hill like MySpace and beboo. This app use to work fine but just like everyone here after a day of swiping for like 10mim, I have hit my daily limit and been waiting and still waiting.. waste of time you might as well go to tinder or hinges"
ananya srivastava,Better then tinder
tinder queen,"Better quality, diverse"
Brandon Buckles,"The app is broken. It will only connect to the internet 50% of the time. No other apps on my phone have this issue. These issues are with an expensive paid subscription, so this app doesn't deserve more than 1 star until they get that fixed. As for when it works.. meh. There's little difference between this and say..Hinge or Tinder. Less trash advertising and scammers than Tinder but less effective than Hinge."
Nick Vin,You guys added a swipe limit? BS! Its even shorter than tinders. If thats the case id rather pay tinder the membership is much more fairly priced. Lost my business for sure. The app also never loads anymore. It literally doesnt work.
Oscar,"Worse than tinder, half of the girls just want ig followers, it says there's noone around me but there 2 girls who liked me around me but I have to pay to see them, -5 stars if i could To your response, what do I get? That sounds like I would be working for you, so what would be my payment? Your app has an issue that YOU have to fix, not us"
Diego Evrard-Broquet,"I live in Brussels and here they just removed the option to sort out people depending on the distance. So for example, I get to swipe people from 2km away then right after 150km away, bad move Bumble you can do better. People are a bit more 'woke', queer and open minded than tinder. Also, as a cis-man I think there a too much guys for few girls (like other dating app) so I'd say dating app are frustrating but still you get to meet some fabulous people sometimes."
robert sexton,"i like the app and the fact that girls gotta message first but theres one issue with that and sadly bumble cant fix. the girls still seem to think its our job to come up with a good conversation starter. ive had girls start off just by saying hi and ill say ""hi how are you"" but because i didnt write a 5 paragraph conversation starter theyll unmatch! girls this is your job if you want me to come up with something good to say go to tinder but if you send me hi ill match your enthusiasm."
Dios De Hueco Mundo,I haven't gotten any matches yet but that's mostly an issue on my part... The free version of this app limits the amounts of swipes but that limit is considerably high. You could look through profiles (of very attractive girls I might add) for an hour before you reach that threshold. The only thing that bothers me is that you have to base your opinion on a person's appearance and occasionally a couple words - much like Tinder - which just doesn't make it easier for me to make a decent decision.
Shivani Deo,"The new interface sucks!!!! I used to like reading about the person AND going through their pictures. Now it's just a trashy copy of Tinder which focuses only on people's photos and, if you're patient enough (which most people aren't), the matter comes last. No one takes the effort to write a good bio because, hey, screw depth. Throughouly disappointed with the new look."
Bernard J,"Bumble a solid app. Can also appreciate its 1 day subscription option. More apps should do this idea its really convenient. And doesnt burn your wallet nearly as badly as say, Tinder's asking price. However recently has been running little more slowly. Which is getting annoying. Could use a fix."
derek richards,Limiting the amount of swipes was the last straw. Tinder is once again the superior dating app.
Steven Imas,Tinder is better
Aditya Raj,Till now i found it better interactive than tinder
Ben McCarty,A downright sexist app designed to promote inequality in favour of women throughout the complete UX. Plus most dates I've met were using Tinder among other dating apps anyway!
Riley Ryan,"App imposed a limit on the number of people you can swipe on and made you pay for the undo feature, seemingly to copy the monetization scheme of Tinder. You're better off not using this one, Tinder's selection of people is better. Bumble used to have the advantage of endless swiping and the ability to undo a left swipe, but now there's no reason to choose it over the more popular alternative."
Adam Leamons,"Very Good - They actually show me people in my area and the distance I set, unlike tinder."
Lisa Harseim,"Best dating app on the market Tried tinder, okc, and hinge and find bumble to be the best of both worlds. I had no technical issues - aside from not being able to switch to BFF and the networking mode??"
Darsh Parekh,"The last update has been a major turndown. The profiles don't load anymore. Half the time the app shows ""you're using bumble offline"". Scroll down to know more was something different that made bumble stand out with competition. Now it's just Tinder with a different skin. Disappointed."
IEYA,"Not bad if you play the game. DEFINITELY better for relationships than tinder, but get some good pics with a good camera and put some work in or you won't get any matches"
J K,"Don't install!! App is the worst dating app. App has been changed to almost unusable in the free version. Long waits after very few likes. so far 1.5 days and waiting. You have many likes, you never see the people to swipe. App is worst then tinder. Not worth your time now. Response from Bumbe about taking away the #of swipes and other free features was a basic generic template. ""We’ve implemented “Yes” swipe limits to help our users get the quality results they’re hoping for!"" = we are greedy"
Sam Mas,"Urgh this is so bad. Use ads just like every other dating app morons. They ask you to pay for everything 2 years later.... i stand by what i said, couple of left swipes and the app becomes useless the only option you have is to pay for more swipes, use tinder, or pof instead bumble is rubbish!"
Lakshit Anand,"Changing the 5 star rating to 4 star, I used to love the ui and it's focus on content over form now it's just like tinder and also focuses mainly on pictures Also lover the vertical scroll over this tap tap view and can't even open or zoom the pics. It's just so sad that the perfect ui was ruined :("
Greg Risen,"Good idea nice girls no ladyboys (I'm in Thailand) so just good one better than tinder,. more to find a soulmate"
Razia Hogan,"You ban people for no reason just. This has made this as bad as tinder now. Travel mode doesn't appear. All paid features now and even though I paid, its no better!"
Nefnate,Far better than Tinder
marten s,"Do not get any matches, i get lots on tinder but nothing for months here i dont think anyone uses it. Also they kept charging me after i revoked my credit information and then customer service was not helpful at all. Over all a waiste of time and dont pay for anything on here they will keep your information and charge you even after you remove your card info from app"
Ritesh Bokil,Works harder than tinder to ensure profiles are genuine.
Missy Owl,It's better than tinder
Dirk E.,Boring app. Notifications which make you discover sealed features because you're on the unpaid plan. Tinder is still much more fun!
Shah Khan,The latest update just ruined the entire experience. It was one of the most easiest app to use and with the latest version we're forced to go thru all the screens. Talk about taking something not broken and then purposely breaking it in the name of improvement. You guys should fire your design team! Stop trying to be like Tinder!
Миша Баглай,What happened with the nice vertical profiles? Now it looks like tinder. Stupid.
Orkun Temel,Way better than tinder!
Chinmay Desai,"This is the best and genuine app I've ever come across. Wonderful platform. No Fake like Tinder, Etc. I don't know why people do mistakes of swiping left accidentally then call this app bad because they charge you for rewind, Even Tinder Does Charge for Reverse but Tinder is Extremely Expensive just like TrulyMadly, OKCupid, Wee, etc no real profile, no calling facility, bad UI."
The Espinozas,"Site will not take my payment for bumble boost, have ran into a couple issues with the site but overall hands down better than tinder all day everyday"
Malakhai Hall,"Terrible app. Hardly uploads photos properly, constantly goes on and off line, and their automatic system ""policing"" of uploaded pictures means I can't load up anything of me in cosplay which is a huge part of my life. Back to tinder I go lol"
Hugues Belmiro,Better than tinder
Chinmay Vichare,"The app is good but after the recent update the user interface sucks .its like copying tinder the reason i am this app bcz it not like tinder,but you are trying to be like it now"
Ahmed ElAssy,Good app in terms of functionality. But it somehow feels 'Designed' to give the illusion that there are tons of people out there with very little chance of getting a match. Same as Tinder
Isaiah,"I think I've had this app for 9 months or more. Trafficked kinda low but I've liked quite a few people and it seems like unless I pay for this will I get likes. Not trying to be a freeloader but I've gotten 5 or ten ""SOMEONE ON BUMBLE LIKES YOU OPEN AND FIND OUT"" me :opens bumble nothing Maybe I'm just cheap but tinder kinda worked but this never has worked. Edit* I've had this app for two years. Never got a match. I was up in Oregon two years ago using this and i only got two matches so far"
Paddy Kerley,I love how in the middle of a pandemic they removed the ability to see how far away someone is... That's pretty essential if you plan on following your local gov's guidelines... Also the new UI... Garbage... It's basically rubbish Tinder with some text stuck at the end...
Sanjay Sunder,"Why did you have to roll out that ugly new interface! Used to love the app. Stop being Tinder, you were really good at being Bumble."
Lorenzo Montano,"You notify me that i should check the app and find matches, only to tell me i ""hit the end of the line for today"". Also the waiting time is atrociously longer than even tinder."
Destiny Stewart,Do I have to pay to see a match like on tinder
Rajaram Tiles,Not usefull anymore without credit.. tinder is good
hannah avit,Better than tinder tbh
Jaden Bandy,"I've used this as both a free paid user and recently redownloaded, it's really bad, you get like 10 right swipes them boom! End of the line for the day no more swipes, they've been taking more and more features away from the free users and it's generally not going well for me now when before it was easy to get matches as a free user, can't ask them to fix it either because you guessed it! Greed! The only good thing about this app is there's hardly any spam profiles vs tinder"
Sean Mercer,Great app less time wasting than tinder
Dave Johnson,"I used to think the app was tops, but man, its gotten bad. don't waste your time. even (gasp) Tinder is better these days"
Nikolaus Weiss,"The new update to the layout, completely ruined the app. Now all the text is awkwardly crammed at the end of the profile, and nothing separates Bumble from Tinder anymore, as the focus is entirely on the pictures now."
Fernando F. Gallego,Now it looks like tinder... I have to go through all the pictures to see the attributes and I got stuck when switching to BFF mode and I didn't have a profile. Looks like a step back. And I still can't select text from the profile to translate...
Adam Larson,Better than Tinder but doesn't match as well as Hinge
Nick Snicklefritz,"This app was probably close to 5 stars last week, my only gripe was that not enough people use bumble. I just logged in and noticed there's been a UI update that completely ruined this app, and so I will be deleting my account and bumble itself. Why did you decide you needed to be more like Tinder? The attraction of Bumble was that it was completely different from anything else, now they've turned it into another copy/paste dating app."
A. D,"Overrated. It feels like an extension of tinder with the exception that the interaction is mainly one sided. Not to mention some of the accounts are either fake or exagerated. Catfishing is an issue. The app lacks matching statistics features. Anyway, it's not the best app if you're looking for a meaningful engagement and interaction with a person. Don't see the value in investing in Bumble. I have found that there are other dating apps that are better from my experience."
Glenn Kaiser,"Easy as tinder. Clean and smooth. Well thought out model if ppl actually cared to fill there profile out fs. This app is nice, so ur surely to finish last."
A Google user,"i like the look and feel of this app. So much better than Tinder. However, it doesn't seem like that many people are on it, because I only get about 2 or 3 options per day."
Wilmer Pedroso,...literally why would you do this to your app interface. The scroll made profiles look dynamic and interesting. Now it's just another Tinder. What a horrible update
Sarthak Dey,Its a shame this app isn't as popular. Its better than tinder solely by the fact that women have a better experience here.
Alex Rohn,I tried again and its still the worst dating app on the market. Matches expire so fast that it feels like you have no chance (nobody has time to search through everyone). Also why should I pay money to see my matches when I can't make the first move and my match will expire? You get no value paying extra money. Also you can't put personal preferences so 90% of the people I see are not my type either. Its literally a worse version of tinder.
Malaya Cansdale,"I really love this app so far! the UI is amazinggg and way better than tinder in my opinion. I love the swiping up and down on a profile unlike on tinder where you could accidentally super like someone. The conversation starters that show up immediately when you match with someone are super helpful. Sometimes I forget to respond to people, so the ""your move"" notification is helpful. The 24hr timer also is nice so people are more active. 100% will delete tinder and move to bumble"
vinay tahilramani,"Aeyyy, your new user interface sucks. The scroll down was much better. This feels like tinder. The about me section comes in late, so seems like rejection rates would go up, I don't know the reality of it tho. Tapping to see pictures of people is more exhausting. And the accident swipe because of your stupid tapping."
aaron b,"Worse than tinder, why can't I swipe after 24hrs has been up? It's like it wants me to waste money on this app."
Josue Godoy,Pretty awesome! Way better than Tinder
David Coxon,Sadly gone the same way as tinder. Won't be using again. Same algorithm bs. Don't pay bumped to the back. Simples. Start off getting loads of matches then it just stops. Same as tinder. All to guide you to paid subscription. Free dating apps are a thing of the past it seems.
Sergio Villa,Way better than tinder!
E J,It has less fake people on here then tinder.
Alisha Gibbs,I like that you can snooze or delete your account without it causing problems for you later. Great app and far superior to Tinder
FSWZ,"The worst part was I paid for a month's subscription to try it out and apparently I can't see whoever had liked me before that I didn't swipe right on. Other dating apps had this feature, but not Bumble. Also I pay lesser on apps like OkCupid and Tinder, so why bother? Hugely disappointing. Other than being able to see who liked me, there's really no point to a subscription."
Jaime Acton,Bumble is the most sneaky dodgy app I've ever used. I recommend trying hinge or tinder at least they are transparent. I will never recommend this app to anyone.
Josh Dabis,Can actually have some quality conversation. Most girls will ignore you after the first message but that more my problem than the apps problem. Far better than tinder and other apps.
Hisham Haidar,Much better than Tinder
Aaron Mccarthy,Way better than tinder
Christin D,"So out of all the apps, hily, tinder, okc, zoosk ect.. I've had the most responses from bumble. I've spoken to a few guys, met a couple, nothing went past that since I'm looking for a relationship and a lot of the men are ""something casual"" or ""I dont know"" which makes it even more time wasting.i dont think ""I dont know"" should even Be an option, you're on a DATING APP so you're here for something? 🥴"
Sarthak Shah,Terrible UI after the new update. The scrolling was so much better and user friendly. This new tinder-clone UI is terrible as it alternates between pictures and profile info so cant focus on either of them properly. Also all the other changes like limited swipes etc made much worse than it used to be. Coffee Meets Bagel and Hinge are soo much better now.
Derek Skor,"There's pretty much no users here. All the profiles must be fake or old and they saved them. And they robbed me of $47 the very first day and I never agreed to it and now they're trying to say I don't get a refund because it's through an app, that's no excuse to not issue a refund 3 days after creating a account and requesting a full refund. I don't check my bank statement every single day but I did three days later and I seen what they did. Do not use this app. Tinder #1."
Antonio Noack,"Ähnlich aufdringlich mit kaufe-Premium!!! wie Tinder; keine Einstellungsmöglichkeit für Entfernungen, und diese manchmal unterschätzt (Luftlinie für alle mit Privatheli...)"
Andrew Norman,Heaps better than tinder !
Josef Kalüf,It's fun.. Better than tinder I guess..
Nate D,Mostly Fake Catfish Profiles. If someone likes you they won't be revealed until you pay for a membership. The free version just keeps saying I have likes but can't ever get a match when swiping and if I do get a match i get the girl saying add my scam Snapchat then they never reply 😂. Tinder is the same but at least they have more real people. Even the people verified is a model with a fake name so can't really trust this app.
Shatter316,"Update: Tinder is Better...at least when u match with someone u can msg freely.., WASTE OF MONEY/DO NOT SUBSCRIBE. I Paid 80 bux for 6 months. I should have the right to message whomever I want for that price whether I'm liked or not. I should be able to message people WHEN WE MATCH instead of leaving it up to the females to message me FIRST EVEN WITH A PAID SUBSCRIPTION. I would have had better luck with tinders paid subscription"
Barbie Cheyanand,"At first I enjoyed the app until I matched with someone, you have 24 hours to respond otherwise your match goes away, also the female has to message first?! which was so silly because I was busy at work and busy the next day and eventually when I had time to message the person my match was gone?! Honestly tinder or hinge is better also tinder is cheaper, and has better features to at least give you a chance to talk to people. Not worth the download, rather download tinder or hinge"
Romeo Juliet,"I'd say it's okay, better than tinder.."
Gabriel Arras,Took away the shake feature to go back to a previous match... was really the only thing that differentiated it between Bumble and Tinder. I get 2-3 matches every month and then the women don't even message; so it's kind of pointless for them to make the move first.
Rohitaash Debsharma,"Amazing platform, way better than tinder, although one suggestion: Let us like our partner's texts while chatting, thanks!"
Brian Barrett,"Download app and jump through all the hoops. Sign up for a month of Boost. Report 3 accounts in a row for responding in the first message ""u a sugar ddy?"". Wake up to being banned without a refund at 4am. This app is a scam. Use Tinder till public areas are safe enough to be able to talk to people face to face and skip the trolls."
Puskar Kumar,Atleast the girls are not fake here in this app. Tinder mein तो ladke ladkiyaan बने बैठे हैं. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Michael Russell,"Very rare for a girl to make the first move, most of the time you will match but you can't talk to anyone because they have to first, but if they don't within a few days you get unmatched. I've spent a considerable amount of time on here and have yet to ever meet a single person unlike okcupid and Tinder where I have much better success. Pretty sad because this app has potential."
Andrew A-WALL49,This is no different than Tinder. Same concept with same amount of luck to be matched (not a lot) there is no difference in trying to see who liked you and the people you match with don't even want to start a conversation. Another dead end for me😒
blowmycake yt,They were superior to tinder until they got greedy recently and removed free features
Aussie Bob,"Shameless cash grab, stick with Tinder."
Oquavion Morton,By far the worst money hungry social app I've ever downloaded. Gives you like 20 swipes after the first day before asking you to pay insane amounts of money to continue on the app. For the love of God... just make a new tinder lol.
Matt,"I used to give this app 5 stars, but now after they made a few changes they now get 3 stars from me. One of the changes they made was that if you made a mistake swiping left you could go back to that person by just shaking your phone. Now in order to fix your mistake you have to sign up for Boost. They also would let you swipe forever. You didn't have a limit. That's what set them apart from Tinder. Now that's part of Boost too. Those 2 big changes cost them 2 stars from me."
JD Nafziger,Actually generated matches that talk. I tried tinder for years. And nothing. Within a week conversations have already started.
Noah,"This app is so dumb, they moderate photos of guys if you have your shirt off they will instantly remove your photo, but they have absolutely no problem with the 8 pictures that every girl using the app has in her thong bikini. I have the same photo that they removed on both tinder and hinge and neither of them have a problem with it. Only bumble. The app used to be good when you had unlimited likes but it's pretty aweful now. I'd just stick with tinder"
Jo Howes,Much better than tinder. Better info on people. Clearer what to do. But i do wish that all messages remained rather than the other person being able to delete them.
Alex,"App gets worse every update. New UI is terrible. Old one was so simple to see people's profiles, this one is messy and annoying. More than 6 photos would be nice. They also cut way back on swipes per day so now way less matches. Plus it will say ""you are out of matches for today"" for a day and a half before it will let you swipe again. I have to force stop the app sometimes for it to reset to a new day. This app used to be better than tinder, but now it's not very good (worse than tinder)."
David Bonenfant,It's new layout is like tinder but worse
Brandon Markwick,What a terrible update .. why did they make the pages like tinder instead of keeping the scrolling ? Ugh .. I liked that it wasn't like every other app and now it is; What garbage ..
S Mac,Just another version of tinder with nobody on it
Mynzelah,Pretty much useless as a free user. Most women who match with you don't message you before their time expires. Anyway to increase the time is limited to a single use before being slammed into the paywall. I've had far more success with Tinder and Plenty of Fish. Don't waste your time on this garbage.
Ojaswi Athghara,"Very intuitive UI but poor UX. There are so many elements to the app. Those makes the UX confusing. Most women don't know that they have to start the conversation and that too within 24 hours. I really don't know why this app exists in the first place. Same as Tinder, but women makes the first move. They can also do that on Tinder."
Joseph Rusyn,Objectively better than tinder. Less fake profiles. Although I'd like to be able to message first as a male and the notifications are super finicky.
Adam,Pay alot to get boosts etc and cost vs people actually using it are minimal. Tinder has a way better return or hinge. Price is way to much
Kenneth Macdonald,Tried several apps and had way better results on this one than pof or tinder or others.
Dan McCullough,"It's like tinder but better. The likes you get are usually shown to you quick, and go away if you swipe left."
Henry Kraft,"I like it for than tinder but this tapping instead of scrolling through profiles is garbage, it doesn't make sense because its not just photos, its not like tinder. Also where tf did bumble friends go? I wanna make friends"
smashd fajita,"Used to be better than tinder, now all y'all want is money. I get more swipes on tinder now than I do here."
thEasy Riider,"Let's get one thing straight: this app is trash. Firstly, the matches wouldn't talk even if you extend the time period until I unmatch them myself. If in 24/48h match doesn't respond, why can't we make the move? The whole concept is lacking. Now to the next point, the app keeps saying OFFLINE while I'm using everything else just fine. I have to reinstall every single time in order to be able to use it. It's really getting out of hand, that's the main reason why I am leaving it. Tinder is better."
AfrodisiShaq O'Neal,The fact that you have to pay just to see who likes you is absolutely absurd. I rather use Tinder again then get ripped off on this app.
vishal thacker,Ok the algorithm is way better than tinder..more in favour of us aka boys matching than just being money fcused and get matches accordingly..... I would say go for it guys ....atleast m getting matches here unlike tinder
Karen M,"By far the best app to meet REAL people. I love the BFF side, you can look for friends without having to swipe through people that only want hook ups or a relationship like tinder...only thing that would make it better is if it showed both genders..being a woman it only really shows u other women and let's face it..guys don't look for guy friends on an app..even if they should lol so if we could see everyone on the BFF side it would be even better."
Tyler Dane,No better than tinder.
Jordan MOOD1E,Definitely hate that you have to pay but other than that it's a pretty good app The women on here are beautiful it's definitely more of a relationship type of app versus tender being more of a hookup one night stand kind of at I recommend if you're looking for a relationship that you download this at if you're looking for a booty call I definitely recommend tinder but other than that the women are definitely more classy than tender women Don't get me wrong tinder has classy women but you know
mojack1999,"For no reason i have been blocked i did not even broke any policies or so called rules of thier, i wanted to give 0 stars tp this garbage TINDER all the way 💫🙌😬"
Che Issa,Tinder is better!
Vincent Wesley,The 24 hour gimmick is terrible because no ever responds in time. And now there's a flood of dead inactive profiles and bots what happened to this app? It's now basically a crappy Tinder with a wait period. Update : Just updating the 1 star. Still trash. But now it's limited and filled with bots and sugar babies.
Daniel Patrick,All you need to know is that it's better than Tinder LOL
Kyo Mocho,"By far the worst dating app. Even Tinder is better because it at least brings your matches forward. With Bumble, even if you get people in your ""hive"", you have to swipe through 1000+ of endless boredom, absolute WASTE OF TIME, because the coding doesn't bring them to the front. I've talked to many friends and they also experience the same. Even if you miraculously match, they only have 24 hours respond, which is another super dumb design. Bumble truly sucks. Worst app. Don't give them any money"
Robby Titan,I didn't know expired matches can show back up. Using the daily extend now too. There are not as many free options as other dating apps but it definitely makes up for it in quality. Definitely like this app more than Tinder. Thank you
Logan Stae,Way better app than tinder
Hisham Basil,"Based on my true experience this app definitely nailed it l, i am so grateful to use it . It is far away more helpful and effective than tinder 😁. I wanna thank all those well presented developers who made this app works.and the company as well. I am really glad to use this app. Big thanks to bumble :)."
Gavin Johnson,Its an okay dating at definitely competes with tinder however i think the demographic of success is based on your country so taken it with a grain of salt.
André Reis,"Honestly this app has provided me with the best experiences in dating ever! Like not even kidding! Honestly I think this app is way better than tinder, not only in quality of people there is but also in the quality of the relations it starts!"
PO -T,"Too strong robot reviewing the pictures. You can't add a little text to make a difference. Plus, very small userbase here... Tinder, unfortunately, still stands at the top."
Animesh Kumar,"Treats men as dogs. Gives them matches then it's disappears in 24 hrs. Hardly any matches. I had more than 100 matches on Tinder. Even dated many from Okcupid, Happn, Tan tan. Very boring and bad UI. You don't get all the information at one place. Please never install this app."
Forever Young,This app is worse than tinder. Whoever moderates this is either a deprived eunuch or just plain retarded. UNINSTALL!
No Body,"This app used to be great but the pay wall is just so insane now. Who would of thought Tinder would make a come back there. Not everyone's there to pay to play. Plenty of other apps that give the user a more reasonable experience, which cultivates the community and quality of the network. But what do I know."
D Green,"Used to be good, now for anything, wants me to upgrade to boost for it's features that used to be free (even though it was limited, was still ahead of tinder)."
Paloma Kostur,"They are letting an abuse victim continue to be controlled by her manipulater. I was 'banned', so I sent 2 emails to follow up. The only person who would report my profile is my abusive former partner, who has done this to me before (reported my Tinder). I explained this but received a dismissive, rude response from 'Mike' at Bumble. After 2 years in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship, Bumble has allowed the control to continue. Sexist, appalling, hurtful."
Teju Chowdary,Such a worst app..i have seen ever Dont waste your time on this app Sooo disgusting....and also the options are not good....profile settings was not good at all...app is not running with good features. The software is soo slow....dont use this app..instead use tinder that's a better dating app .
Decker D,"Better luck on here than tinder but serious cons are the paywall to match and recurring daily subscription fees being continuously charged even after canceling the premium features in the app. You pay via paypal and each transaction becomes a new recurring payment schedule created in your paypal account which you must manually delete in the paypal app under recurring payments as well (all of them, can end up being dozens). Complete scam to continue recurring charges after canceling in-app. F-"
anderson alvin,Better than tinder for sure
Simon Goodall,Pretty good. Nice balance between tinder triviality and ok cupid tedium
Christian Zapien,Better than Tinder!
sunil sahoo,"This app has all the prettiest and classy girls around... than tinder, ok cupid, happen. But I'm not getting a single match... Wonder how many people I'm visible to... If it wasn't for lockdown... It's way easier to pickup a girl in real life or match on tinder than this app. Paid feature is also expensive... There's another nonsense here... Girls message first... "" behenchod, chutiya ho kya??? "" Here in India some girls ego is way bigger than your entire company. So..."
Sireah Warden,"Female user: The app is way better than tinder. I have found the guys on here are more patient and are of a higher quality than tinder users. A good mixture of people, easy to use design and actually promotes reading profiles by way of easy scrolling down the page to read their comments to questions nestled between the pictures. I love the colours in the GUI. Really nice app. I guess by higher quality i mean that the guys feel like real people compared to tinder."
Jason Smith,It was call fire thought I was a frequent bumble user and wood has highly recommended this app as opposed to a lot of the other apps like tinder or plenty of fish or match. Unfortunately someone was able to log in and credible complaints and I am now banned for life from bumble for no apparent reason without explanation or the individual in question.
Devin L,"26 pending matches, none of which I ever seem to match or unmatch by swiping on, even though I see the same people multiple times. You have to pay to super like or go back a person. Every feature is behind some kind of pay wall to the point where I think they hold back matches unless you pay. 5 minutes on tinder I had matches while here you can spend days. Just go somewhere with a user base this thing is dead under their current model."
Dileep Prashank,Excellent dating app. I have 27 girlfriends now and all of them are willing to marry me. Way better than Tinder. I got only 18 girlfriends from Tinder.
Food Is My Weapon,Awful. Go to Tinder.
Matt,"After I had either matched or swiped left on the 33 initial likes I had it was like my profile stopped getting exposed. I'd get 1 like or so every couple days as if my profile was suddenly completely undesirable to everyone. I had a pretty consistent flow of matches when I used tinder... The ladies messaging first is a cool idea but usually they just message a simple ""Hey"" or ""👋"" which gets old fast. I recommend downloading hinge for finding dates during the pandemic, it is 1000 times better!"
Thomas Hyatt,"It's still fairly early days and we've probably only spend 10 hours chatting online and 20 meeting in person, but I think I may have found the woman of my dreams who I will spend the rest of my life with, all through Bumble. 🥰 The app is easy to use, puts women in control and seems to be aimed far more at serious relationships then something like Tinder."
Peter Damgaard Mouritsen,"Much better experience than Tinder, and more relevant matches"
Jonathan Higgins,Love it. 100 times better than tinder
Andrew Jack,Damn and I thought tinder was bad...
Tamau Roget,"Better than Tinder, that's for sure. I sign up when I'm bored and it's quarantine, so I'm bored. I never keep it long enough to say it's worth much, but I decided to go a little longer than 24 hours, ha! I met someone before a few year's back but the date didn't amount to much. Matches seem to come in and now they have a daily $2.99 fee you can do instead of committing to a full month and so on, so that helps when you get those pesky ""someone likes you"" alerts."
Parker,"It used to be a lot better, but one of the problems I have with it is I cant delete prompts. It only lets me update or pick another one. Also it takes more than a full day to reload your swiping ability. But theres still some great things about the app. Most of the people aren't bots like on Tinder and women messaging first is a great idea."
Ark Unknown,Less quantity but more quality when compared to tinder
Daniel Koos,"I won't overcomplicate this. You don't pay, you get no matches. You pay, possibly you get 1 or 2, didn't try, and never will. Even Tinder is better, and 90% of the women there are just promoting their Instagram. All in all, this app is a scam, wouldn't recommend it even if they offered me £5,000."
HANI NO ZUKA,Kinda frustrating when the people who liked you are not more likely to come on top like tinder.
Mariano AM,"Nice app, it is better than tinder/happn. Buena app, es mejor que tinder y happn."
Jordan Richard,"They fixed a bug with the spotlight coins I had experienced, I guess. The app is a little pricey compared to Tinder. Other than that it's a good app."
James Young,Great app. I like that there is an opportunity to post more about yourself than just a bio like tinder.
C J,"This works fine. I get all appropriate alerts, people respond to me, and the profiles show relevant information about a potential relationship partner. The people getting upset over conversations disappearing should recognize the other person deleted them haha. This is not a flaw in the app. This is a really great free app. Not at all like Tinder, unless you don't make your intentions clear in your profile."
Kevin Ganz,I got a few matches in the beginning and then I haven't gotten a match in months... Actual months lol... I know it's not me because it's not like that with Tinder. It's pretty obvious they want you to put an absurd amount of money into this
Jettanut Aimwatcharamarch,Think tinder is bad??? This one is even worse
Stuart Kelso,"Tried this for a couple of weeks to no avail. It doesn't tell you how long untill your swipe rights replenish, if they even do. And it didn't give you many. Kept badgering my to upgrade to get anywhere. Doesn't give you anything different to Tinder or Blendr."
POJ Infrared,"Beware of this App, women will use it to stalk you. This app points to every neighborhood you're in. So where you think you have privacy the app clearly provides people with your actual location (not the distance between you/them) like Tinder does. You now are equipped with a mobile tracking device in your pocket. If you're ok with that then the app is pretty cool. For women by women."
John Perkins,Like Tinder except they expect you to pay for matches. Junk.
Christopher Burk,"I love the idea of women making the first move! Using Tinder most women expect you to say something so witty and ridiculous, but not all guys are gonna do that. Sometimes you don't want to say something witty and you want to start small. This just makes it so much more comfortable for us guys who aren't always so witty 😅"
Sazquatch Scotland,You have to pay to see who liked you. I am not doing that. With Facebook Dating and Tinder why pay $30 a month for little chances?
Christopher L.,Best dating app out there 1000% better than POF or tinder
Shubham Dhurve,It's a nice dating app. You can set your preferences as well. Can really compete with Tinder I feel.
J Man,"The app will give you matches at first, but after an hour the matches stop. I've noticed that there will be a lot of matches in your upgrade que, but they won't show up unless you buy the premium. This means they are locking matches behind a pay wall. This is disgusting. Women aren't a commodity to be traded for money. The women are better than on Tinder, so that's a plus. I'd say 1/10 actually are interested in meeting up, but the rest are fake accounts or women just wanting attention."
Tejas Modak,Over a month i haven't got a single match! This is the worst app. It's not like you am horrible or something. I used to get matches on tinder pretty decently. This app specifically is not even l trying to push me in the queue.
Shubham Pal,Finally we have a replacement for Tinder!
Valia Corsi,"I've used this app for roughly six months, and can confidently tell you that its one sided by a long shot! Unless you are extremely attractive, it is difficult to get matches. And when you do match with females, a majority of them won't message you anyways. You might as well use Tinder, because that's how useful this app is. The only benefit is that it forces women to break the ice first, which never happens on different platforms. If you are looking for a relationship, I wouldn't try this app."
Kyle Henkel,"Waste of time, used to get several matches that was equal to what I got on tinder. Now I don't even get any matches at all."
John Oyarce,Best app in the world! Way better than tinder
Jamie Cichan,You literally have to pay for features tinder gives you for free
Jermaine The Rock,If i could give this 0 stars i would. You are better off trying your luck with tinder or even hinge. I canceled a small subscription and ever since the app has been deleted km still getting charged. Its obvious that the people who made this app as well as most of the matches you will care only about one thing. Money!
rentaspoon,"Slowly ending up more like Tinder, the 3 free rollbacks are gone, they hide matches so you debate buy a membership. 2 stars because I've had luck on it but if you expect ""classier"" women than tinder it's not the case, more people with open relationships on it and I've been offered more threesomes than on tinder so I guess there's that."
Jadzia 518,"Too much like Tinder. Not much space to write a proper bio. Kept giving me notifications saying I had matches, even a name at one point but when I checked there was nothing. Waste of money and time if you're looking for more than a hook up."
Jordon Ashe,"Amazing, better than tinder"
Tom Eayres,"Three updates in three days? No notes on updates? Bye, bye Bumble! Pay to see matches....bait and switch just like Tinder. Never pay for a dating app.....ever! All ready uninstalled, why would you reach around for a message?"
Eryn Shackelford,"If you can download something else, dont get this one. I had this app back in January but deleted it. I reinstalled it yesterday and I already hate the updates they made. Tinder at least has a swipe limit that resets 12 hours later. But 24 hours? That's insane. And its almost criminal what they charge so u can actually swipe and get matches. Revenue is important, yes but im honestly thinking of deleting it after one day because of how low the swipe limit it and how long the time is to reset."
Rabbi Haim Goldstein,"Used to be a great alternative to tinder, and then they started putting microtransactions on every feature on top of their new ""facial recognition"" software that literally deletes/moderates completely safe for work photos for absolutely no reason what so ever."
Chetan Patil,Its real . This is the only app apart from tinder which really works.. and also lets u swipe more profiles in a day than tinder. But unlike tinder it doesnt place the profiles so that we match easily. Also after 24hr matches expire if the woman is busy. @app developers. Make money but keep if affordable say 100rs a month and see the enormous increase in subscription. Just try it for a month. Good luck
BenthefmrTxn,I can't give no stars. App constantly says I'm out of profiles for the day and that I need to pay for more even tho multiple days go by between when I open the app. I didn't think I'd ever prefer the bots on tinder. At least the clock on that app works
lady Sharon Anderson,"Withholding matches to manipulate sales, matches no different to tinder"
Thomas Buko,"It just doesn't work, the thought sounds good on paper but in practice its very limiting to men and what they can do. Tinder is much better, I can at least send a message first. Also the whole BFF thing and whatever else they added just seems weird to me. Had better experience on pof than on here (and pof is bad to) @bumble support, you guys are nuts and thats why this app sucks 👍 but you keep doing you and wonder why you failed"
Abhishek,"Just a pathetic money grabbing sham.You'll get tons of likes in the beginning but eventually they stop coming.And you rarely get a match if you have not paid but after reading the other reviews it seems like even after paying,you don't get enough matches.I downloaded this app because I don't have to make the first move,which is awesome but is it just me or do women really suck at starting a conversation?If you only allow women to initiate but then they don't then whats the point. Tinder's better"
999 gamerdude,"Actually, really like this app, it's the best I've tried so far in terms of people actually having profiles rather than just the single picture no bio of tinder. Unfortunately not enough people seem to have realised this, hence there is definitely a lack of people swiping and I'm getting matches 50+ miles away. Come on peeps get on here."
D J,"Women text first, except that they don't. They'll either wait for the time to expire, send an emoji or just a simple hi(double standards? How many times have we heard them complain about men sending just hi/Hey/hello?). So what sounded logical is again just a gimmick, it's Tinder but with the guy's hands tied behind his back. You'd have better chances finding someone at the bus stop."
Kamohelo Mofokeng,"It's user friendly, matches happen more, it's waaaaay better than tinder. But the yellow textbox is really bad for the eyes it would be great if they could change it or introduce a night mode feature cause that yellow textbox is too bright"
Det Woj422,Its straight. Better format then Tinder.
Nikhil Mokal,Far much better than Tinder!
Misha Schmidt,"It could be a good app but it has a few major flaws, first off the fact that you cannot adjust any pictures that you post and instead just have to hope that it fits properly is ridiculous, also there is definitely something wrong with the distance limiter because although I have put my distance as 5 miles I keep getting matched with people who are 10 miles away or farther. Fix these things and maybe give a few undos for free like Tinder does and it would be a good dating site."
Haris Wadud,Does not work. Haven't gotten a single match in 6 weeks of playing. I usually get 2-3 matches per week on tinder
Zach Bagot,"For men, slower matches than tinder but higher quality for sure. About 1/3 to 1/2 of the conversations I have end with a date."
Jarred Yudin,"This app is pretty much pay to use. You have limited swipes, cant see who likes you without paying, cant backtrack without paying. They pretty much copied tinder and made it pay to win"
Freddie Fantastique,"Possibility to send photos, voice messages...a mix of Tinder and Whatsapp. Also a plus every account has a picture!"
rishi dadlani,Good app Met a few lovely people Better and classier then tinder and other stupid apps.
Landon Frigault,"Great App honestly. You can actually know what you're swiping on because the profile is more then photos. I just find it a little annoying when it prompts a retry whenever I left swipe a potential match. 😂 If you want results, bumble just wins over tinder."
Gary Anderson,Stupid. Like tinder but pay for it!
The Forthcoming Triumphants,"Okay, it's got potential, 4 starts for now. I just got a match. Her name is kiana. I like that i can videochat with her here. It's so reassuring. And she messaged me. So I know she actually wants to have a conversation. My back used to hurt from all the conversations I would carry. But its different, And I'm only about a week in but I've had better luck here than tinder, pof, clover, and meet me. And I haven't even subscribed to premium yet. I'm playing the long game. Making friends."
A S.,"So since you keep bugging me for a review. Your app charges DOUBLE what tinder charges for their premium and gives you half the swipes tinder gives you. Your app use to be better than tinder but you got greedy. Think about your costumers not how to line your pockets. ALSO to add insult to injury YOU STILL POST ADS! You done nothing to get rid of the fake accounts and dont give me that lame excuse of ""we are doing our best"" you've done nothing but find new and inovatoative ways to be greedy."
Paul Moseley,Terrible update get 10 swipes a day if you want more pay or it says come back tomorrow. Well thanks for that oh we also want to charge you to backtrack now! So basically you've changed the app/site to pay only well no thanks. Whoever has decided on this change worst decision ever. You've now copied Tinder but gone one worse make you pay to get any use out of the app. Waste of time
Alex F,App used to be good. They took all the free features and made them paid. Funny how they're a money hungry tech company but then virtue signal with their BLM support. Supporting blm doesnt make you any less of a money hungry shill. At this point tinder is much much better. Much better.
Mich Po,"An app that doesnt even let you contact women if youre a man. And you're just supposed to sit there and wait until someone messages you. Yeah right. This is even more pathetic than Tinder. Never mind the $25 a month you can spend to see who viewed you, but you still cant message them. What a dumpster fire. Delete this app and go outside and talk to people, its way better for your health. Its too bad I have a broken leg otherwise i wouldnt even waste time writing this review."
Skyler D,"Used to be really good, now after the updates most things are locked behind pay walls. I see substantially less profiles now and matches have dropped off. It appears they are not showing your profile as often to other people unless you pay more. Old Bumble and Tinder worked very well. Now they are only money grabs. Someone redevelop these! *They also now push the political agenda of Black Lives Matter into the terms of service"
Robert Bowen,"Poor version of tinder, do not waste money on this gentleman."
William Baumgarth,Use tinder instead
Chris Tomiko,"Like the other dick Smorgasbord, Tinder, this app also just destroys woman's ability to make good decisions in the dating market."
Jennifer Hogg,"Kinda like tinder, but the woman having to message first is a nice spin on it (: I definitely dig this app!"
Mic air,"Worst dating app ever, use match, PoF, or even Tinder this one won't even let you delete your account. Charge for just about everything....simply not worth it go somewhere else."
Taj Misquitta,Now let me clarify that I'm definitely not an ugly person. I have the same photos and Bio on Tinder and Bumble. On Tinder I typically get 3 to sometimes 4 likes per day on a monthly average and 1 out of 5 is a match. I've been on Bumble for almost a year and I've been putting more attention to it over the last and ongoing months. I've got 4 likes and 1 match and even with boost for a week I have never even got a single match after. The women don't even reply. The app is not worth time or money!!
Geradessiel Simon,"My experience has been a fair exchange! It has been all,for me all that it endeavors to be-I especially appreciate not having to be labeled gay because I prefer my brother's-having been separated from my brothers as a child & youth. I have used many sites,this one is different,and a better difference:a open ""flow"" as communication should be-with all the social distancing! For some reason I get more responses here than I did with Tinder!"
Kyle Hemeon,Matches locked behind paywall. It's basically just a version of Tinder with more expensive micro transactions (As if that was even possible) and less people on it.
Azrael Seraphim,"Not enough matches, women ghost, and skipping or not wanting to mention something leads to an unfinished profile rather just accepting it and completing the profile. It's now a invalid excuse for you to get less matches. Also, like Tinder, it's not free. I'd get more matches, but would have to pay to see who liked me."
Nicholas Brown,I didn't update the app so they took down my account just get tinder seriously
Steven,Fancy tinder.
Richard Williams,Bumble is good option in this complicated world of dating. It's still functional as free app allowing u to like and chat w users once your matched. You can also send photos which Tinder doesn't offer. I've also had good success w dates that are interested in meeting too
Jeffrey Hamlin,"More classy than Tinder, but not as many options"
Dave,"Garbage. All match owned sites (bumble, tinder, okcupid, match) are all the same. The goal is to get your credit card and that's it. You won't find any success on here."
Christian Cormier,"The girls on here are the best. They seem down to earth, and the fact that they message first shows that they are really looking for something remotely serious if the conversation goes well. There doesn't seem to be too many users in my city, but this app is way better than other apps like tinder."
Dale Janssen,"While bumble is doing well to put a stop fake profiles, they've taken a page from Tinder and are now blocking matches behind their pay wall."
Greg,"Latest update keeps freezing and crashing and they took away the free ""swipe-back"" feature and made it cost money a couple updates ago. Not as many fake/prostitute profiles as Tinder (they're still on Bumble though) which is why it's 2 stars instead of 1. Offer verification, fix your app (I have Samsung S10 with latest updates), aggressively remove snapchat, prostitute, and fake profiles, and bring back the Free swipe back feature to increase your rating👍"
Tyler Selesky,"No more backtracks? Time to uninstall, looks like Bumble is now 'Tinder'"
Matt,"It's just a money making scam now. If you don't pay money they don't show you anyone that's liked you. Like, 1 a day maybe. If you pay, they show you more. Same as tinder. Just a money making scam."
David Kelly,"You have to pay to see the likes you get. App is honestly a little better than tinder with a better user base, but having the free version be so limited kinda makes this not worth using."
Dark Zed,You turned into a low class Tinder congradulations on selling out. Instead of limited likes you give us limited people to view asking us to upgrade for more views. How pathetic. You replied saying g we get hundreds of swipes which is a lie. I just downloaded it again and I have even fewer swipes now maybe 30. Stop lying.
Bij Dikh,"Tinder: 10M+ active users with $9.99-$14.99 per month for membership, and you can swipe your limit every 12 hours without a membership. Bumble: 1M~ active users with $24.99 per month or $9.99 per week for membership, and you can swipe your limit every 24 hours. Don't worry, the developers don't know how to code, so this feature breaks a ton and you can bypass this via brute force."
anthony zavas,"Bumble sits halfway between Tinder (shows distance to date) and OKC (lots of written bits). The potential mates seemed hi quality but rarely matched. As for UX, user can click 1st photo of potential mate, but scrolling runs into a snag. Beehive holds many mates but costs. Annoying. Anyway good site and possible dates seem good too. If you could shift from behive to the rate at which dates appear. So you would have free access to behive but they would appear slowly."
Nada,AWFUL!!STAY AWAY. Each time I emailed them they didn't address the issue and sent a standard response-not even providing a solution.i paid for a week-said bumble booster and cant even use it and miraculously no ones viewed my. Profile and visited users disappeared. Awful.the worst. Tinder are much better and address the issue.this app feels like a scam as I paid for one week and no service oit of it.
Imran Hussain,Grate app better then tinder
Evan,"App continues to nickle and dime. This used to be so much better, now it's a bad Tinder clone."
Smit Shah,Better than tinder
Jeff,I like it overall for providing more info than Tinder. But it's still restrictive. App forces you to provide both a job title and employer name/industry instead of just a title. Same for school and graduation year. That made me knock a star off for lack of flexibility
Gabe Patton,"I have no clue why they would REMOVE features. You can no longer back track in case you accidentally swiped left on someone or didn't look good enough. On top of that the whole ""24 hour limit"" thing is dumb. May as well use tinder at this point bc at least they let you superlike for free. 🤦🏾‍♂️"
Anthony Ramos,App is so far fine. But why don't you make it 48 hours at least in case the person is busy. Very anti consumer sometimes just like tinder
Kabeer Raj Singh,Better than tinder. At least you get some matches
Samuel Aguilar,"It used to be great, but now you can only slide a few times a day (way less than in tinder), so it's pretty annoying."
Pranav Nayak,"WAY bettet than tinder but I reckon the icing on the cake would be to have an all access pass day once a month for users. Especially when someone matches on your beeline Edit: Had 3 stars originally, but after returning here after 6 months this app has slowly turned more tinder-like. It used to have unlimited swipes and you've clearly not taken my original suggestion into consideration"
Lun Hing,"No more matches after a week on the app. I downloaded tinder have 80 matches first week. Then hinge about 45, I'm never on it. Bumble is racist bunch of white people on the app. literally only got like 15 matches after a month. Numbers don't lie. my bumble and tinder account are almost the same. Just because my skin color isn't white doesn't mean I don't like getting Matches. BLACK LIVES MATTER"
Tyler Shuman,"This app sucks now, you'll get way more matches on Hinge, and hinge won't make you pay for any of them. Bumble is basically just tinder with less of a userbase at this point."
Keagan van Rooyen,"Safe, secure and easily matched. Bumble is the best dating app, above Tinder for sure!!"
Ben Klappert,"Started an account and have been banned for life before I even got to use it, wouldn't recommend. tinder or hinge are miles better anyway"
ZTK,"It used to be free, but now you have to wait 24 hours to start again. It feels like you swipe for 2 minutes, then it goes ""youve hit the end for the day."" There are too many fake accounts, and they are wanting you to pay for everything. At least tinder lets you swipe every 12 hours, and you get way more of them. I left tinder for this app, but now Im going back to it."
Christopher Manning,It's a great app and I've never had any issues of finding great like minded people. Definitely recommend over Tinder.
Marc Wanagas,An app with shittier humans than Tinder.
David Myers,"It's not a bad app, haven't met a lot of people but I feel like it's better than tinder"
Dr.Abhay singh,I installed this app for atleast 2 years but didn't got even a single match It's a fake application with fake profiles Fooling people Will not recommend to anybody Waste of time It's better to use Tinder Tinder is better Going to uninstall.
Andrew Smyth,"Locked me out randomly one day saying I wasnt 18+ even though I'm 19. Just deleted it, not worth the effort to get it back, basically a bunch of tinder rejects on it anyway."
Ray McCann,"VERY strict photo guidelines, such as no bathroom selfies. My photo was removed because I didn't have shirt on, but it showed from shoulders up. No reason to remove it. Automatic one star from me for that reason. This isn't a religious app, so stop acting like it's one. Rather use Tinder."
Totally_Not_Skyler,Pretty good I like it better than tinder and hinge. So take that as you will.
Melissa Yanez,Uninstalled after one day. I hate that the location has to be on at all times. Even when just messaging! Thats why I hated tinder. It drains your phone so much! we should be able to just enter our location. And I wish we could see everyone we liked.
Adam,"Bumble is the exact same as tinder now, the only difference is women have to initiate the conversation. They've gotten rid of the free 3 back swipes and I rarely get matches since the most recent update. Will be deleted if things don't revert back to how they were. Hinge is definitely my favorite now."
Chris,"Very simple and user friendly. Uses the Tinder model of like pics>>read bio>>swipe right>>match>>converse, except the girl has to make the first movie (no idea how it works in nonbinary sorry). Keeps matches within your search radius. Easy way to meet locals."
Matthew Alonzo,Waste of time. Just download tinder👍🔥
Beanzor,This app doesn't work at all! It's been 3 days since I've ran out of swipes and it still hasn't refreshed. The app has been prompting me to buy it in order to get more swipes but we all know that ain't gonna happen cuz this app has way to many other problems that need fixing. Like c'mon! I got people that have swiped on me and I can't even swipe back. Even tinder is better than this.....lol
Aaditya Deshmukh,Good app. Better than tinder anyway. But still paid people get more preference.
M. V.,"Horrible... This app USED TO BE GREAT NOT ANYMORE. I recently installed and started using this app after months of not having it anymore. I see EVERYTHING has changed.. It used to have so many advantages over Tinder but I guess it was just a matter of time till it became a gaff too. You have to pay to do literally any and everything.. It says you have hit your matches limit for the day (after 5 mins of swiping) now 2 days later it still says wait till tomorrow, yet I've been waiting 2 days now."
Raptor Man,"Just another money grab ... Don't bother guys, girls have to say yes twice, once because they are shallow like tinder & second time because they are bored."
Atiba London,"Not really sure how review this app? It works? Not really glitchy. It's pretty solid for thumb exercise. It has also taught me humility in realizing I'm pretty sure I'm just ugly. Uldate: 5/31: On a real note though, there essentially the same as Tinder now in operations. The backtrack feature (one that's been free for years mind you), is now being touted as some new discovery that's behind a pay wall. AND they've suddenly limited the total number of swipes per day. Just Tinder... But yellow"
Corbin Butler,Better than tinder
Benjamin,Has become better than tinder in many ways.
Henry Steinberg,"This app has gone to HELL. You used to be able to do soooo much more than simply, like or dislike. Now you have to pay to do everything. Tinder is 10 times better"
Karl Hinze,"This used to be so much better because it used to have advantages over Tinder e.g. unlimited swiping and free backtracking. Now you have to pay to get anything decent. Backtracking now requires a Boost subscription, and you run out of swipes really quickly. To make matter worse, while Tinder gives you a countdown for when you can swipe again, this just says ""wait until tomorrow""... which it said yesterday and I've been waiting since! Tinder is bad, this is now worse."
Ryan M,"Now with limited swipes, just more Tinder-like garbage. Patriarchal capitalism trumps feminism once again except it's an inside job. You've really done a lot for women by attempting to milk your users for every penny you can, Whitney Wolfe Herd. 'great' 'job' What's the term for an uncle Tom but for feminists?"
Manthan Jain,This used to be a great app but in the recent update you won't get any shake and go backwards option...that was the only thing I liked about this app and gave it an edge over tinder
vasu dev,Better than tinder.
Criss Prima,I'm disappointed that they started charging for backtrack. That was the one thing they did better than Tinder.
Andrew L,It was a good app but they take away free features that made the app better over time. The most recent one was where you had three chances to go back for whatever reason. This is extremely annoying and as overpriced as tinder.
Modest Mouse,Used to be a good app but it's recently turned in to a tinder like app where you essentially have to pay to match with people. Try elsewhere.
chris merritt,Leave it to a dating site during covid to actually make you pay more instead of less. Greedy company now not even giving us 3 backtracks or any anymore for free. You guys now join the ranks of tinder who charges for everything. I recommend people to try POF APP can message first for free and a lot of the same people on both apps anyways. Drop this greedy app guys.
Dalton Heick,"You have to pay to backtrack now. Unreal, thats one of the reasons this app WAS better than tinder because if i accidentally got in a swipe fest i could undo it but now, im not sure if ill use this app again"
Vincent Nguyen,"I used to like bumble because of the free backtracking, it's what sets it apart from other apps like tinder. Tinder still provides superlikes and bumble doesnt provide anything 🤷‍♂️"
Daryl Wash,It used to be a great app. They have now gone the route of tinder with limited swipes unless you pay. What's crazy is I actually did purchase some things when the app was free. Not anymore. Updated : You are now not able to backtrack for free. They've pretty much gone full Tinder now. 👎🏾
Austin M,"It's really neat that I'm paying a monthly subscription and still need to pay for a super like, or whatever they call it. And also seeing an ad every now and then kind of stinks. Tinder has it right."
Jack Duff,"I was charged £2:50 a day for 3 weeks when it originally told me I was subscribing for just 1 day. I emailed to complain and request a refund and was refused. Stick to Tinder, people!"
Jeremy Warder,"Had the app before and it was a good dating app. Redownload it and have come to realize bumble has taken the EA approach to business tactics. Why make good content for people when they can just lock everything behind a pay walls. When you finally get to use any part of the app it either doesn't work or freezes and forces to close. I finally got to use likes and I got like 5 of them then had to wait until the ""next day."" Time to delete and go back to random matches on Tinder.."
Paul Partington,"Used to be pretty good but then they decided to copy Tinder and bring in a fixed limit on how many times you can swipe per day as well as starting to charge for the 'backtrack' that used to be free. For all the differences there used to be between this app and Tinder, there is virtually none besides men being blocked from showing initiative and able to message first. This is effectively Tinder Lite, and not in a good way."
Elijah Jaden,"The app works fine and it's a good app to use just not enough matches and you have to pay to get more swipes when you are ""all caught up"" with the people around you just make it like tinder where you can have limitless swipes but your out of likes but not a bad app to use and I did get 1 or 2 matches out of the 6 months I had the app"
Grimnest,"My profiles on other apps are exploding, bumble while bumble has been barren. I have 2 people in my beeline and despite trying to match with them for the past 2 or 3 days havent, which tells me that they were never even put in my shuffle. I've used spotlight twice, its had little effect. I matched once, they never messaged. Avoid this app, just go to okc or tinder Reply to BHL, I have had no filters activated. My search is as broad as possible, women between the ages of 23 and 38."
C. Antoine Jean-Baptiste,"Search radius settings don't work; vast majority of profiles are more than double the distance specified. Became more greedy than tinder! The developers should read the reviews, as of now Bumble's rating is lower than tinder! That's a serious fall from grace."
Robert McCafferty,"It won't let me decide if I want to see men or women. I have to see men. Bumble has decided I'm gay. So I guess since I'm not gay, I have to go back to tinder."
Tony Tanon,"I liked bumble because compared to tinder, you could backtrack for free and I felt it wasn't just all about money. Now, covid is here, people are using dating apps more than ever and guess what, you have to pay to backtrack now. I also have two likes but no people to match anymore, so I feel like they don't make you match with people that liked you right away so you keep using the app and pay. So now I'm coming back to tinder because it's basically the same and more people are using it."
Bo Norris,Very much better than tinder could ever be. At least girls actually communicate on here!
aziz hussain,Pathetic dating app ive ever seen in my life... Getting 1 match in 2-3 months... Tinder is better than bumble... Never recommend this to any of my friend.
Nihil River,Better than tinder
Liam Lafferty,"Aye naw bad. Birds are expecting Robert burns on tinder. For a chat up at least. Ladies now have the power with bumble . All I got was ""hi"" ... luckly enough still got ma hole. 5 out a million x"
DEBADYOOTI PAL,Bumble is better than Tinder. Period. It's really curated to your needs and the crowd is really good. ♥️
Drew Kubo,"This used to be a great app. Now your swipes are more limited than tinder, and half the time you don't get notifications."
Jeremy Jeremy,"Used to be great. I live in a capital city, when I expand distance from 20 miles to 100, it says no one new around. Paid for the premium, still terrible. It's the new tinder, just used to boost ig followers. Would be nice if they set up a swipe activity and only showed profiles that recent swipes right on some profiles, and removed the inactive people that never swipe or actually try to go on dates."
0 0,"Better than Tinder and Badoo, use this over them."
Shakira Lewis,"It's actually a pretty cool app. My opinion is that it's 10x better than tinder and any other app for meeting people I have been on. They really consider what you want and the way the design of the app is, is really cool."
Nico Pigan,Let me explain the logic of this app. You match just like tinder but the woman has to make the first move. But women never make the first move and even write in their profiles message me first so after 24hrs if they haven't messaged you you will unmatch. Biggest waste of time!
Brock Johnson,Better than Tinder
Grubb Schmuck,"Garbage app. Tries so hard to rip off tinder but fails miserably. Instead, it is far far worse. 90% of the profiles I see is either a bot or fake. Do not recommend."
Kaede Komatsuzaki,Honestly much better than tinder
Braden Rice,"This app is an upgraded version of tinder. Has more to offer in terms of optimization and a slightly more interesting way of meeting people. I do like the 24 hour rule that if you don't hear from someone in 24 hours they disappear. So it's not as tedious as tinder in that regard. It's still kinda annoying you have to pay to see who liked you no different than tinder. While this app is just about as limited as tinder, I give it an extra star for being less tedious and having more personalization."
Gerald Schneider,"The app itself isn't bad, but user behavior/etiquette leaves much to be desired (m4f, dating mode). Over 2/3 of my matches have failed to start a conversation, which kind of defeats the purpose of the app. Maybe an in-app penalty to discourage this behavior would help? Meantime, please step it up ladies, and save the idle swiping for Tinder."
Eric,"Bumble is like Tinder, but better. The only drawback of Bumble in my opinion is the smaller userbase."
4lden,Less shallow than tinder. You get a better feel for people early and letting the girl set the tone is a nice touch.
Marie Kris,This app used to be way simpler and safer than Tinder. It has been over 24 hours hours and I still can't see who else i can match with.
Renata Lang,"Way better and more meaningful than others like Tinder. People on here seem caring and open-minded. The personal profile allows one to showcase core values & traits like your religion (if any); if you consume alcohol/cannabis/cigarettes, have kids; your pets; exercise; star sign; etc. There's also fun prompts for your profile or as a convo starter like: Secret Skill? Favourite pasta? Nicest things someone has done for you? I particularly appreciate the ""BFF"" mode to make new friends. 💌"
Yasmin Eid,"As someone seeking a long-term relationship, I find more serious people on Bumble than on Tinder. I also like its interface, colour scheme, the fact that there are filters other than age and geography."
Shaun Daskam,"Bumble is light-years ahead of tinder, or any other dating app for that matter."
vibhor vaid,"Unlike tinder, you don't meet people just for hookups/ ONS. You can find people for meaningful dating too on Bumble."
Joffie Lovett,One of the only apps that requires verified profiles. Why Tinder isn't able to roll this out is ridiculous.
Karl Gustafsson,better than tinder
Kenneth baur,"Better than tinder, but any dating app can get kinda depressing if you struggle to get matches so use at your own risk."
Camden Boyd,"I found my forever partner here!!! Never would have expected that. Highly recommended, but make sure you're using Tinder as well to have the best chance of finding someone."
Rob Mount,"Like it, but you don't get unlimited swipes, and when you do hit the end of the line it just says that's it for today. Could do with a timer like tinder to tell you when you can start swiping again."
Coinrin G,"Overly sensitive to swipes. After remaking an account after having one for 2 years with a slight mistake, the exact same photos have been 'Moderated' and removed with no reason given. I think I'll stick to Tinder for now."
Sanchit Goel,Tinder is times better
Ryan Howe,"It's pretty good, quicker to run out of likes compared to tinder though"
Luxnarr,Better than Tinder I would say
Darren James,"Was a great app for ages but in the last year or so has got worse and worse. There used to be no limit to how many women you could swipe on but there is now. Bumble used to give you up to 3 backswipes if you swiped left on someone but wanted to go back, not anymore that's part of the paying service. Also far to many fake profiles and sex site workers providing snapchats. Reporting service doesnt work half the time. So if you want a dating app that is practically tinder now why have bumble ?"
The Alphatron5000,Trash app. Crappy moderation. Stick with Tinder if you still want to swipe.
Farmer Dan,Better pool of choices than tinder
Savannah Smith,Kinda like tinder but with more options than just dating. I like it
Vikrant Thakur,"Good application. Not like tinder,isme like aate h 😂"
Lord Cameron,"4 years and counting with zero activity. It's essentially just an ego boosting app for women, which isn't a bad thing; just useless for men. Think: Upscale Tinder without the payoff of actually making a connection with anyone."
Andre Hala,Better than tinder
Minh Van,"Good system, way better than tinder"
Tyler Kasper,"This app has gone downhill. I like the concept, but since they switched to the ""tinder"" model of having limited swipes, the app seems to pick a number between 5 and 100 and that's how many swipes you get for a day. It's arbitrary and annoying."
Apoorv Srivastava,Better than tinder. And easy to use.
Jacob Geyer,Decent app with good layout I prefer it more than tinder
Christian,"Good app, a bit different to Tinder."
Silver Holland,"Counterproductive. On Bumble women need to open a conversation after a mutual match. But they usually DON'T! Men are wasting their time. Generally I see the same types of women (just fewer) as on Tinder, where no such extra hurdle is imposed... What's the point, Bumble???"
Big Gay Inc.,"Was able to swipe through fir one day. It's been well over 24 hours since the app told me to ""wait until tomorrow"" to go through again. Worse than Tinder."
Hari Shankar,It's an awesome app. Really good and quality matches on it than on tinder.
thechristenedone,"This app is a complete waste of time, this is like a bootleg tinder and I am so done, uninnstalling!!!!!! 😡😡😠😡😠😠😠"
Joe Fernplant,Dont bother getting this app. It isnt the better tinder. You have to pay to see the people who match you. They take the person who swiped on you and hold them in a pay to see folder because ofcourse that's how dating apps work. As far as I read they also have a habit of scamming money away from customers so do not pay for anything. This app was good once upon a time bit they sold out to be another pay to play dating app.
G B,"Bumble used to be a nice option to Tinder, but it too has begun limiting swipes and requesting paid upgrades to continue. It was a good app but like many others has become a generic subscription based dating service. I recommend staying with tinder as it is more widely used and bumble is no longer free."
M P,I've heard so many stories of people on Bumble being charged for things they did not use or did not know they had purchased due to their free trials. I deleted my CC info off the app and they held on to my info anyway and still charged me because I couldn't find the greyed out cancel subscription option. I requested a refund but obviously these scam artists don't offer refunds for unused services. Stick to Tinder they are so much more accommodating and don't try trick people into paying.
Aashish Kumar,This is better than tinder❤️
Rianna Artinger,"I liked it better than tinder but the app is pretty buggy (doesn't always send a notification when you have a new message/match, crashes, doesn't always refresh correctly unless you close the app and restart). It's a nicer platform so I keep it but it could definitely use a lot of improvement."
chris pitch,(Update with im not intrested in becoming some borg like computer hive mind thing i will pass)Ok delete my first reveiw ill give another your app showed up as bumble F in my spam folder on my gmail so this app is just like the rest its a scam and ot feels like tinder and i feel i wont find what im looking on here because i found this app in my spam folder not sorry the truth hurts and if this gets deleted again i will report the app and repost the same reveiw
Benette Cezar,I dont like this app! Tinder is better than this..its expensive..i dont know if it really works when you pay!
Justin Shipp,"Almost deleted this when I got a notification that I had a match only to pull up the app and see that it was a lie. Every dating site or app seems to do this. Yall way too focused on money instead of making a decent app. How do yall think yall can just go ahead and do that without pissing people off? And if I ever do get a match, i have to pay money to even see who it is? Damn that's even WORSE than tinder and others. Disappointing. Just more of the same. Was hoping bumble was different."
Chuck B,Those horrendous youtube ads make me want to scratch my eyes out. I'm a good looking guy and I've received a grand total of 3 messages the whole time I used this garbage dump of an app. Just download tinder instead and thank me later.
Dhruv Gupta,"Fake App, dont install and pay a single penny. Worst app then tinder"
Jihad Rasuwl,"This app is good if you are interested in older unattractive women. I met one woman in person and she already had a hysterectomy and was very unattractive in person. Then, she got mad and blocked my number because I didn't text her after our date. All the other women I met on this app were older, uptight, opinionated like my grandmother. There are other apps better than this one, like Tinder and Zoosk. This app was a big waste of time and money."
Enrico Shippole,Worst dating app I have ever used. 2000 matches on Tinder and multiple dates. About 15 matches on Bumble and it is very unlikely you will get messaged first.
Lauren Burke,I think the app is better than tinder. It easy to talk to people as a women on the app. I haven't been able to make a date with anyone. It's hard to get people to make plans. It's hard to engage with people to a point. Not entirely the apps fault. I would recommend it if your over tinder.
brandon ramsfield,I like this app better then tinder
Alex Dloge,The format sucks it's like POF & Tinder in one knock off app that doesn't work right! Horrible interface save yourself the & just download Tinder...
John Vinecourt Jr,"Loads of matches on Tinder, loads of matches on Hinge, zero matches on Bumble. Constantly have to open close and reopen application to make it refresh, else it thinks today is yesterday and I have to likes left. Don't waste your time with this trash."
nikita thumm-rouse,"I love how much you can know about someone before messaging. Lots of details on the profiles, more options than Tinder ."
Mark Koenen,"Premium features not worth the money, had much better luck in my area on other dating apps. Matches either don't talk to you or can't hold a conversation. Edit: I'd just like to double down and rate the premium features as a rip-off. There are plenty of better dating options available, such as Match, Tinder or eHarmony, depending on what you are looking for. Bumble is in a tier with Plenty of Fish."
Ben Foreback,"Completely worthless dating app. I have no idea what Bumble's algorithm is, but clearly it doesn't work. I've never gotten a match, and I'm a decent looking guy. I've gotten matches on Tinder, OkCupid, and Match, but never on Bumble. Worthless."
Electron Recycler,"How have you ***STILL*** not adding a function to scroll down faster through the camera roll when choosing photos, or edit/crop them to fit properly like tinder has. The stupidity is astonishing"
Shishir Srivastava,"The idea may seem better than Tinder but their algorithm is so crappy. Waste of time: do not recommend. I tried the Bumble 14 day trial and swiped normally. That is to say I didn't swipe right on everyone. Not getting any matches, I had three girls try to find me on Bumble to test if I am even visible. Even after filtering to my profile filters, they didn't find me until almost the very end of the queue. I understand not getting matches, that's just life, but for being one of the top online dating service, they have to either make all profiles equally visible or be more transparent about how their algorithm works. I am betting even after getting their paid service, they are relying on you to pay for the ""Spotlight"" bonus to make your profile even remotely visible. What a waste of time."
Paula Lopes,I like Bumble much more than Tinder because people share more about themselves in their profile and especially because most people state clearly if they want something casual or a relationship.
Isaiah Loewen,I liked bumble because you could swipe as much as you wanted for free but now you only get a few a day it's just a worse tinder pretty much
Trevor Cabrera,"Huge dislike after they changed the app to now allow less swipes per day - I'm aware of the yes limit, but it's so extremely low I deleted the app and recommend you go to Hinge or Tinder instead."
Jeff Ric,"Very bad experience. I used Badoo, Tinder, Bumble and others. Badoo was the one that I had more fun and real dating. I have never met anyone from Tinder or Bumble. Bumble has been the worst for a guy. I have been having more interactions on Instagram."
Daniel Roesch,It's okay. But is the next best thing after tinder
Corey Harmes,"Way better than tinder, less of a hook up app."
Kishor Meshram,Very lovely app ..better than tinder !!!
Niv J.,"They limited the number of likes to about 10 per day now...which is supposed to increase the quality of matches? But it's no different than CMB, where that model doesn't work. Bumble removed their undo swipe feature, and their Superswipe is about 2x pricier than Tinder's. It's like Bumble decided to adopt the worst of all features from dating apps. Pretty disappointing😑. After scrolling through the reviews, it looks like I'm not the only one who disagrees with the direction Bumble is taking"
James Wilson,One of the better dating apps BUMBLE and MATCH are probably the higher class apps TINDER is fun with spicy people..be careful...some ask to go to different chat apps ..say NO GET GOOGLE CHAT IF YOU DONT WANT TO GIVE YOUR NUMBER OUT.. I WOULD RATE BUMBLE THE HIGHEST
Sassy Squiid,"The app used to let you ""backtrack""( if you accidentally swiped left) for free, but now they're charging you $12.99CAD a WEEK to do so VS Tinder which charges you $20 a MONTH for the same thing. It's now more expensive than Tinder with no real perks. The amount of deleted/remade accounts is still astonishingly high, even though I shouldn't have to see the same profile twice after I've already said ""no""."
Krus Yaldabaoth,It's less the app's fault than it is with me but I only had deep connections with 2 ppl and it was due to not knowing this was also a business app. The dating side definitely have shades of Tinder which just doesn't attract the right population.
John Nazarene Dela Pisa,It's like Tinder but weird
Brad Knudson,Changing it down to a 3 star instead of 4. It used to be a nice platform that actually tried to connect you with people. Now it limits how many you can swipe on a day. Dramatically increased its premium price with no increase of worthy features. Its not any better than tinder yet tries to charge significantly higher for less features.
Nate Stringer,Much better than tinder
Sarah Williams,"It used to be a good app, better than tinder in some ways & less gross vulgar guys. Then they changed it to where you can only swipe right on 50 or so people & that's it. If you don't talk to those people or if the match is gone after 24 hours that's it. It's been days & it won't show me anyone else at all. I can't swipe right or left unless I pay for the upgrade. It's now worse than tinder because at least after a day tinder will let you start swiping again."
Robert Borntrager,I just think it's better than Tinder.
Edgar,"This app sucks, Tinder & okay cupid are better. Super swipes do nothing. Drop this app"
kamal zakhar,"Never pay for this app this is a scam, i have used tinder which is far better thn this garbage . I have gt 100 plus matches there so, if you ever want to use any dating app tinder is the best. I tried to contact their customer care,they said something is wrong with my profile i laughed and said ok ."
Duval Kit Borinaga,Tinder is way better. You have to pay to know who you match with. Such a disappointment. I say ZERO STARS.
Alex Navarro,"Less grungy tinder. Gives women the power to start a chat, which if they forget they matched and it expires, it's pointless. Why swipe right on someone you don't plan on talking to or getting to know them? It's basically tinder with one extra feature."
The Count of Monte Cristo,"Don't buy upgraded version because they will not refund it. This app is worst than tinder, which is saying a lot."
Franco Barrera Hernandez,"Very good, the best one out so far, much better than tinder"
Bonny Faulkner-Hollis,"Good idea, better than tinder. But the settings don't work. But dumb"
Chiz TheSaiyan,Worse than Tinder. Limited likes and hungrier for money than a homelessman during a pandemic
Taylor Panus,Its nice because the ladies have to message first. This app feels more serious than tinder.
Adolph A.,"I have never had a positive experience on Bumble. I want this review to be simple and straight to the point. It's a money hungry app that doesn't offer any incentive to not use it without paying. And when the incentives are paid for, they aren't worth it. Bumble is a cash grab of the worst kind and preys on people's ideal of starting a relationship through and online dating platform. There are far better apps to use. Hell, I've even used Tinder with success. If Tinder is better, than no thanks."
Tony,Not as good as it used to be. The swipe right limit is less than Tinder now. They have increased their prices as well. Way to take advantage of the coronavirus pandemic.
Shubham Modanwal,Better to be on tinder. Here there are asking for payment even for a single match. It's disgusting.
chris,Worst app ever. Keeps asking to verify and get stuck. Been 2 days now still waiting on verification. All sucks. Extremely flawed. Just use tinder.
Daniel Levell,Definitely better than tinder. Being a somewhat nerdy man I definitely don't get many dates on tinder. But I have achieved a reasonable number on bumble. I also generally have more intelligent and interesting conversations on bumble. I would recommend it if you are not super attractive and not looking for a hookup.
John Hoppe,"Pretty sweet, sometimes it benefits to pay to play so to speak but its a solid app. I like it better than Tinder."
Jon Gage,"an aggressive moneygrab of an app, with possibly the most uselessly condescending social media support team of any app I've ever seen. ""intentional connections?"" my guy, how about you give me *any* connections before you force open my wallet. tinder is worlds better in actual functionality, which is a damned shame because bumble's concept *was* so much more interesting and promising."
Anuj Saxena,It's a wonderful app with genuine profiles. It's way better than Tinder or its ilk. True to its objective it truly empowers women by leaving the ball in their court. It also gives us men the satisfaction of knowing that you'll be connected to real people and not some miscreants behind fake profiles. It also gives men the pleasure of receiving pickup lines from women! Highly recommended. Way to go Bumble!
JLJLo,Made an account and swiped for maybe 3 or 4 mins and it has now said for 3 says I've used my daily swipes. Lol this app used to be the way to get off tinder and now it's a complete joke haha. Shot your selves in the foot . I'm guessing the next time I make an account I'll have to pay just to use a username
Thomas Appel,"Gives you maybe 20 likes before making you buy ""boost."" You have to wait 24 HOURS before you can even see anyone else. Not even tinder is that bad! Obvious money grabber, not worth your time. Maybe try making money off ads instead of subscriptions!"
Kyle Bolton,"Better than Tinder, but that's a pretty low bar. I have made many connections thanks to this app. The paid services are much higher value than tinder. The app appears to have fewer bugs as well"
Yogesh More,"Indians, its a ""Useless app"", waste of money Just collection of photogallery and nothing more... TINDER is superior"
ElectrumVOLT,"Good concept, but very poor execution. Most people on this app don't even know/understand how it works. ""Message me first, I'm too shy"" okay Becky, well I guess you'll find no one on here since you know, you NEED TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE. Time expires too quickly and it feels like it doesn't matter since even when you match with someone they don't even care? Would rather waste my time back on tinder."
Tiru Sharma,Definitely better than tinder.
Derek Riggs,"Better than Tinder imo. I think a big reason people don't like apps like these is they don't put enough effort into their profile. Gotta put a little bit of time into your bio. If you're lazy, your results will reflect."
MiKe S,Worst app cause it takes forever for the swipe to reset for sure more than a day. I get twice to three times as many swipes with Tinder. Matched with over 7 people and zero converstations
David Esmas,App works perfectly.. i haven't really matched up yet. Idk why lol. Im certainly not ugly but like maybe its bc how the profile be set up maybe?🤔 Overall tinder is superior imo.
Ryan A,Use to be a good dating app but has slowly turned itself into tinder and mostly a waste of time
Robert Spielman,App is glitchy af also the people are not really good matches. I've had much better success with tinder or league.
chirag kariya,Definitely much better than Tinder
Dallas Llewelyn,"Like tinder, but more disappointment"
michael byrne,"Very good app. The only thing that let's this app down is it's user interface, which is not as good as tinder. However it is leaps and bounds above hily in terms of user friendliness."
Caleb Morche,Using Bumble instead of Tinder is like using Lyft over Uber.
Ryan Stallings,Used to be nice with unlimited swipes now u have to pay so it's just like tinder with less chances of talking because the female still has to start the conversation 😂
E Villapudua Noriega,"About to uninstall, been telling me I can't swipe anymore unless I upgrade. It's been a day. I guess back to tinder."
Justin Beek,Basically Tinder with extra steps
harsh singh,"No matches at all, all I get is one or two matches on the first day and that they do seem like bots who just match and never really msg. This app has started to behave like tinder."
Ugochukwu Owoh,The stupidest app I've seen so far. Can you imagine blocking me just 2days after downloading the useless app. Not as if I like it anyways. Tinder and pof much better. Getting uninstalled ASAP
Yaqoob Official,Wasted i can't delete my account is boor boor boor best tinder.
Dhrumil Mer,Its such amazing..& better then tinder...i love it..multiple option is like something different thing...☺️
Randall White,I can not believe they STILL maintain those ludicrous prices. Twice the price of tinder plus. Get a grip
Nicholas Johnson,"Actually pretty good! WAAAYY fewer fake accounts than Tinder, though of course they really want you to pay to unlock all the extra features."
Tom Cushnie,Better than tinder until you find out only women can message first! How rediculous. Plenty of matches but I can't message them first because of this stupid rule Bumble has imposed on the app.
Tony Vega,"The main advantage this app had back in the day was the unlimited swipes. And now its worse than tinder. Today, I literally swiped on 10-15 people and apparently hit the ""daily limit"" which is obviously very inconsistent, and then everyone i have matched with doesn't even freaking bother to respond. This app is a joke. Absolutely freaking ridiculous. I'm done."
Zack Hartmann,"It's pretty good. Better class of people than Tinder, but they need to work the kinks out of their messaging platform - I often am not alerted to new messages, and conversely, when I leave a WiFi network, I'm re-alerted to old messages as if they were new. Also, it's constantly telling me ""you're using bumble offline"", and ""you're back online"" for absolutely no discernable reason. Overall, the UI is often disconcerted and consistently network latent, but it hasn't stopped me from loving Bumble."
Robert Toms,"Nota good app, women normally expect men to send the first message and this affects the use of the app, it needs to updated to be more like Tinder"
Jason Cogle,"The app doesn't work properly on my android. When I asked for a refund, I was asked to uninstall and reinstall, which I'd already done. I guess I'll just have to dispute the charge on my credit card. Although Tinder has some scammy stuff going on, I've had better luck with Tinder."
SiahCj,"Used to be good, but lots of the female accounts stay active long after they have deleted the app & Even when you get matches responses don't happen. This app had potential to be better than tinder, now you may as well just have tinder. It's the only dating app on play store that is somewhat ""real""."
Jon G,"Since update, ruined. Not even worth logging on. Get maybe 10 people to see before it locks you out for 24hrs. Had a good thing going, now worse than tinder - Good one bumble, way to lose users 😂"
Bianca ZeroWay,"Better than Tinder for sure. I don't know how, but the people are much better curated. What I like best is that you can tell right away whether or not someone wants a serious or a casual relationship."
Dustin Provost,"A blatant ripoff of tinder. From an employee fired from tinder. A woman who apparently has a lot of mental problems. Read an 'article' about that creature and her hate for men was crazy and completely out in the open. Apparently, bumble is staffes by only women. Also, I actually tried it. Not very many people on it and women still dont message (of course) even after a match. Also the psycho that made this app actually thought she could get away with charging males more money for premium."
Sumanth Munikrishnappa,Tinder is better.. anyday
Jake Eakins,"Use to be a super good app, now it's trash. Hopefully they change the coding back to the way it should be until then gonna be using Tinder more 😂"
Jp Vaca,"Exactly like Tinder, limited number of swipes and wait for a match, minimal to zero profile content, if you want to see you liked you, you have to pay, if you want to ""stand out"" you have to pay, like all dating apps if you are not very good looking you will need to pay"
Virgil Stoian,"Same thing as Tinder. 3 matches after 3 months of using it, none of them started a conversation. What's the point of being on a dating platform if you're not using it? Loads of profiles which are probably inactive. Only good to kill time, but have no expectations from it. Uninstalled. Update: since coming back on the platform, I've had a few matches and I'm currently talking to one of them. We've had to postpone a first date due to COVID-19, but it's only fair to update the rating."
Brook Lee,"Worst dating app online. You have to pay premium to meet women and barely any women use the app. I tried tinder instead, got way more matches from cute girls. Def would not recommend this app"
LilHell Demon,"Unless you pay money your getting 1 match a month if that. Barely any swipes, most are bots. Tinder 2.0 niceee"
Tim,"Just reflecting what most recent reviews are saying. Waited a whole day, swipe 3 times and then the app said I had to wait another 24 hours. Even Tinder averages about 10 swipes per 24 hours. Then I was match with someone 80miles from me even though I set the max distance to 6miles."
Mason H.,"Only lets me swipe on about 5 people per day then it says you've reached your limit, and asked to upgrade. No where near as good as tinder, if you could call tinder good"
kevin bruns,You're worse than tinder now. I wait what seems like 20 hours to be able to swipe again and I swipe right on maybe 10 people before I'm out of swipes again??? Trash app. Were all stuck at home thanks to covid and you're basically forcing people to pay for premium. You should be ashamed.
Ramon Silva,Accounts are fake. I have better luck with Tinder
Lukas Mäks,"It's like Tinder, but there are more options available for basic information about height, education, religious beliefs, drug use, and so on."
Isaac Fitzgerald,"It's a great app compared to most other dating apps. However, on tinder when someone likes you, they are moved toward the front of your swipe queue so you can match quickly. With this app, I keep swiping and swiping and I see that I'm getting more likes each day, but I'm still not getting matches. The likes aren't disappearing, so I assume I havent swiped left in them. That's pretty much the only thing i dislike. I'm here for matches, not to swipe until I hit the daily limit."
shane merrill,might as well be tinder...
Taylor Steven,"The app is promising with a better quality selection to choose from than Tinder. The problem with bumble is that no messages can be exchanged unless the woman messages first. Something many women still don't do. So no matter how many times I match with someone, 9 times out of 10, they disappear after the 24 hours. Overall juat a waste of time"
Keegan Haas,Just another tinder app really. Differs really with the females having to reply first. Still fun to talk to new people.
John Smith,"Sep 2019: The Federal Trade Commission sued online dating service Match Group, Inc. (Match), the owner of Match, Tinder, OKCupid, PlentyOfFish, alleging that the company used fake advertisements, and engaged in other allegedly deceptive and unfair practices to trick hundreds of thousands of consumers on Match. The complaint alleges that Match then banned these users from accessing the services they paid for. Time to put a stop! BUMBLE is even worse! They will rob you on this app!"
Jay Brush,Lame. Tinder knock off that won't put people that likes you in your swipe line. Not unless you shell out the dough for premium membership
Froggo Doggo,"Don't bother with this app, Tinder is far superior. The odds of someone seeing your profile compared to Tinder is infinitesimal. Not to mention the fact that even if you do match, the girls never initiate so you just watch the timer run down. On Tinder I can talk first if the girl is too shy."
André Fantozzi,"Pretty new to it for now, but I like it over my experience with Tinder, as it actually makes girls (who always say: won't message first) have to start the conversation so it puts them into already showing interest in you! I've got a great match & am happy with it already. Profile layout looks simple & good, it lets you put more info about you even to smaller general details like smoker, drinker, pets, workout etc. It has a good Chat layout & functions as it actually allows you to send photos..😉"
chase heck,Better than tinder
Jonathan Davern,"So I am still owed super likes from a previous account or maybe it is the same account, honestly don't know why I came back. The app is designed for you to mess up a waste super likes. Literally just did it twice. Don't both with bumble it's not different than Tinder, people just want you to add there insta or snapchat etc. Tinder has a much better UI, OkCupid has a million questions for better matching. Try those first. And then still don't try bumble."
Knight of Astora,"In trying to set itself apart from Tinder, bumble seems to have inadvertently made Tinder more appealing with its limited time messaging function. With Tinder, paying for premium improves your chances of matching significantly but its not needed to use the app normally. With bumble, paying for premium is necessary just to talk to someone if you don't message them within a set time frame which makes it more difficult than tinder to actually connect with people - the entire point of a dating app."
Emily,"I used to really like bumble and have been on and off it over the last year or so. I met a great friend who I'm still friends with on the bff section which is great. But like other people have also said, the guys don't even want to meet up anymore. Maybe the women too I don't know I don't speak for them, but the majority of guys are time wasting narcicists who only want one thing. It started to feel more and more like what tinder did, a hook up site. I want something genuine so deleted."
Brandon Schreiner,The new prices are a joke... back to tinder it is
IcantdenyReality,Better than Tinder
Michael Chimenti,"Used to be able to get dates every few weeks from this app but it has been ruined by the recent update. Used to be able to swipe as many people as you wanted, now it's limited to less than tinder or hinge. Time to uninstall and move to a functional dating app. Don't bother wasting your money."
antonio castiñeira,Somehow this works thousand times better than Tinder
Face Man,Somewhat better than Tinder. Still some fakes. They limit swipes.
Krinova Lidia,Very negative. This app is money drainer. The feedback system sucks - automatic reply. Just go Tinder or any other app
Cyber Apple,It's a good second to tinder just need to work on the glitch notifications
Trae,"I've been on this app for months, the UI is sticky and frustrating, most the profiles are fake, everything you try to do asks for you to subscribe to it. It's just diet tinder that doesn't respond on the first swipe and is trying too hard to ""stand out""."
Ryan Kincaid,"This app is mega wack. They decided to copy the worst part of Tinder and limit the number of swipes per day. This was the only good reason to choose Bumble over Tinder. So, do yourself a favor and skip this app."
Lenon Melric D'Souza,"Nice app, I personally prefer this than tinder."
Erdal A,"""you've hit the end of the line - for today! Upgrade for more people"" Looks like bumble is capping swipes like tinder and asking for payment to continue swiping. No thanks, bumble. Thumbs down on that decision."
KCKK RRHC,Good better than Tinder
Elizabeth Escobar,Don't waste your time or money. I paid for a 6month subscription and I'm deleting it at the 3mo mark. A lot of other reviewers hit the nail on the nose. Profiles don't seem real. I hardly connected with anyone and getting spam notifications when no one is there or no new messages. I've paid for membership to tinder and had better luck and actual connections. This app started off great years ago but it's not that great anymore.
Jimmie Jackson Jr,Now I can't pick my own profile pic AND pay for unlimited swipes like Tinder during an pandemic? Wow
Dennis,"Find this app to be awesome, it's just like Tinder, except gives more control to women."
Mark White,"No matches unless you subscribe! I have tinder too, both with the same profiles pics etc. I get matches every day on tinder, yet not ONE single match on bumble. They do however state that I have had 50+ likes in the last 24 hours alone, but you've guessed it, you have to pay extortionate subscription fees to reveal them. Honestly don't waste your time."
Luis Fernando Gil Monsalve,"It's very bad... Better Tinder, Grindr or others..."
Danny Vo,"This is the worst dating app that I've ever used. They don't offer a refund for unsatisfied customers (I emailed them and never got a response), spam you everyday with notifications that aren't matches or msgs, and I have basically the same photos and descriptions as other dating apps and still next to no matches. While on the other dating apps I get more matches. OkCupid, Tinder, and Hinge are better."
Vedant Mishra,Much much better crowd and UI than tinder. Highly rated.
Mobile Devices,"The app has a critical programming flaw where it does not register your purchases. As a test, I had a female friend receive a paid ""super swipe"" from my account. She never received anything I paid $1.99 for and was still never shown my profile. This app is a scam and best avoided. I receive between 10-30 likes daily on tinder, but none on bumble with the exact same profile. I am verified and have never been outright banned."
Judy Wong,Better than Tinder. The guys do message back and chat. And i love the phone icon. chatted to a few and thats awesome.
Faishal Bashiruddin Ahmad,susah amat match nya ga kaya tantan ato tinder... ni udah ada yv love gw tapi ga nemu... mending tantan sekalian dah
gourav dhakad,"If you are a guy then read this. It's better than tinder, but it's still like tinder, just play Left right game, I am bumble boost member. I am really in doubt if bumble shows my profile to girls. I am just wasting my time and money, In hope if someone likes me back. If you say I am not looking good. Then I want to tell you that I got almost 10 likes in Okcupid, and they all are real. So guys please don't waste your time in apps like tinder and bumble."
Sharleen Chandra,Better than tinder. More profile prompts make people seem less one dimensional. Message notifications not always reliable.
Anish Mathur,As of now the app looks good but I haven't got a date yet. If it's better than tinder then it's been a month have been swiping.
David m Brunelle,This app is so nice and simple to use!!! Also much better than tinder I.M.O.
Taniuta,"I really like the app itself, BUT, it's very frustrating as a lesbian that I constantly get notified by men that like my profile, same on Tinder. PLEASE reset and implement your filters accordingly, it is such a waste of our time, I'm for sure not the only one experiencing this. We could use some target efficiency in times like now ;)"
Aman Singh,I like this more than tinder
Thomas Mgte,Worked very well in India contrary to Tinder
Isabel Van Tassel,So far it's fantastic! I've already connected with quite a few individuals who really seem to get my vibe. I'm honestly really happy this is exactly what i was looking for. Its literally like tinder but for finding friends. Except you don't completely judge a person on their looks you are also provided information about them and what they enjoy doing. So you can see if you have the same interests as them. The only annoying thing about this app is that it keeps pushing me to pay money to upgrade
Matthew Wright,"For developers of a dating app to help small businesses, it's amazing. I don't think I will be one of the grantees, but regardless, amazing stuff guys. The app itself is good. I prefer it over tinder, although I don't use them much."
nate gustafson,Terrible app. Tris to charge you $25 for what used to be free. Tinder is much better
Aushim Das,"Way better than Tinder, lol"
Dorkmax,Bumble puts a limit on how many times you can swipe unless you upgrade. Made me head to Tinder real quick because its annoying as hell.
Martin,"Just another worthless dating site that doesn't screen out spammers and scammers and doesn't provide any customer support. Match, Tinder, Plenty of Fish, Bumble.... they're all the same. All they want is your money."
Wayne Carter,Good app. Much better than Tinder. People are much more real
Connor Turley,"I had preferred this over Tinder due to its unlimited swipes. Now that's gone right out the window and I even get fewer than Tinder as far as I can tell. Tempt me to pay for better features, don't hold features I used to have for ransom."
Jimmy Magee,Limited swipes smh if i wanted that I'd be on tinder they have more per day at least.
Subhankar Mishra,This app is just like tinder....
Taylor Latsha,"Tinder = people mostly trying to BANG. Bumble , the clear winner, is people actually attempting to treat each other like human beings and even friend."
Soro Asadi,"If I could I would give it a zero. The app is like tinder. My biggest problem is I payed the £2.49 for a 24 hour access. Done this once more. Didn't like it so I delete my account. However, this ""company"" has been taking further £2.49 from my account since I have deleted it. Or is my account ""deleted"" as your app said???? I'm trying to contact them, of course no contact number and their contact emails is just about bragging or the press or how much you love the app."
e xler,"Better than tinder, i like the concept of having the girls talk first... Nice interface overall and not too pushy when comes to ads"
Dark Link121,"A great app, better than tinder and match in my opinion"
Chaz Zimmer,"Great premise, just rarely get matches. I love the idea of girls messaging first but I can't tell you how many times I've had a match expire even after extending it. Whether it was someone who doesn't check the app much or if they just decided they weren't into me is unknown but it still feels like kind of a waste of space in my phone. I prefer tinder still. As a huge plus there arent any bots on this app though."
God Bear,"Their new update is garbage. They limit the number profiles you can swipe on, and you can only use it once a day. That's worse than Tinder!"
Tathagata Dey,"If Tinder is for the poor, illiterate idiots, this one's for the rich, literate ones. Or that's how it feels in India. It feels less sketchy than Tinder, I'll admit that. Probably should have an option to look up all genders on bff mode though. It's a little weird that bumble thinks you can't have friends from a gender that's not yours."
Alex Anastasiu,It's a breath of fresh air from Tinder. It's amazing how many beautiful people with common interests you can find when you filter people based on what they're actually seeking
Dipanshu Mutreja,Way better than tinder!
Shreya Murthy,Better app than Tinder in my experience. Still has some bugs especially where the chat is concerned. Doesn't always load properly.
Emily Valdes,"Amazing! Such a cute concept and design, is a morally conscious company, gives you billions and billions of matches. I had to stop swiping because I was getting so many beautiful men in my dms I had no clue who was who anymore lol. Had Tinder before this. Never again."
Trent LeClaire,So this app just turned into Tinder? Have to pay to get more swipes? Tinder = Pay for more swipes + either person can write first. Bumble = Pay for more swipes and hope the girl writes you. 🤣🤣🤣
Zeus Steaks,Bumble is really trash. The idea that girls message first is refreshing. That being said bumble is not. You only get like 25 swipes a day. The premium tier is outrageous. One day of premium is $2.99. A week is $9.99. a week... A MONTH IS $29.99. CAN YOU IMAGINE DROPPING $29.99 TO USE THIS GARBAGE APP? You must really be an idiot to pay $30 over $10 for a month tinder plus.
Commander Crumbcake,Terrible app. Met 1 person in 2 years. Even tinder girls have more substance. Very disappointing
Sterling Hager,I dont have much opportunity to go out and meet people. I'm starting to wonder if all the profiles are real.there is history behind bumble and tinder. the dick pics and ignorant men kinda ruined it. In my opinion tinder was biased towards women and Bumble is Biased towards men. I think both sites use algorithms to keep you swiping instead of dateing. My pic got deleted of me at an indoor pool a towel thrown over my shoulder it was a selfie of my face.I see pictures of women much more provocative
Skippers The Penguin,I have gotten a single like within a 3 week period get tinder I have gotten 40 likes in that same period by far a better app. DO NOT GET THIS APP
Mark G,Hottest chicks are on here like Tinder but also the fussiest. Expect a challenge.
Abhinav Yadav,Better than tinder
Hannes West,"Great app, would choose this app over tinder any day. More classy and still very easy to use."
Omar Rana,"fantastic app, so far it's proving to be much more successful then tinder"
Bashir Abbas,"Great app for dating, making friends, and networking. .Better than Tinder that's for sure."
Christopher Gallegos,Since when do I have to upgrade the app to be be able to have unlimited swipes? That was literally one of the only reasons why I (not for much longer) used Bumble over Tinder.... terrible update and major mistake on the developers!
Rachel,Easy to use. Not laggy like Tinder lol
SAGAR DUBEY,"I maintained a very good profile, i was on tinder i got 12likes and i tried this app for 2.5 weeks 0 likes apparently it was asking money."
0701jim,Messed up the app. Used to be better than tinder and now i get limited swiping a day and no one initiates conversations. Waste of time. Change it back to what it was before. It worked better.
Kathryn White,Classier than Tinder!
Andrew DeLong,"Wasn't bad, a different way of doing the dating apps. But they introduced charging and now it's the poor mans tinder"
Julius Joyce,Basically I've waited more than 24 hours and I still cant even swipe or do anything. Just use Tinder at this point if you want at least think you are actively doing something.
wanda ludlow,No dates like in tinder
Ryan Cox,Basically a worse tinder now. Has all the restrictions and monetization of tinder now except I still can't send messages first as a guy. Used to be decent but now it has all the downsides of tinder plus I can't contact first and there's less people on it. Do not recommend.
Nicholas Frink,Getting me connected with cuties more than tinder
Nathan Richie,The nickel and diming to get you to buy Boost/premium is getting worse and worse. Now it's barely usable. I can't believe tinder is less scummy for once.
Florence Wright,"Now that they've got a bigger following, they've decided to go the Tinder route in a pay-to-play. Now you have to wait to find more matches and pay if you want to keep going. Disappointing."
Zurg BeeBlazin,I get like zero matches on this app while on tinder i get a bunch. Dont waste your time on this app. I like the way it works better but no one uses it. Either that or their algorthym is trash because i cant get any matches on it and i know people with a similar problem too. This app like doesn't work.
Tony Malin,"Modifying my review. The app still sucks. It gets +1 star because less bots than tinder, but i'm taking that star back because you can't buy a match (literally or figuratively) if youre a regular joe. Okcupid blows bumble out of the water."
Elijah H.,"There's not enough space to fit my comments, but my issues completely agree with the other low star reviewers. I actually thought the app was better than Tinder when I first downloaded it a year ago and was completely functional, several updates later I'm having the same issues reported by others: -Filters not filter out all men from ONLY WOMEN. -24hrs is too short, but any match I say yes to has 1/10 chance of she initiates a convo. -Notifications of matches that click to nothing shown."
Ann Pratley,Stopped working unless I did an update but there is no info about what this 'improvement' is and looks no different to me other than now having 'beeline' shoved in my face every time I now go to search ... waste of my limited mobile data doing the update but app wouldn't work without it. back to tinder for me... bumble has no respect for people who don't have unlimited mobile data plans. pity as I prefer this to other dating apps
Shaun Stewart,used to be good until they started to go more like tinder. making you pay to get matches.
Jason Alldredge,This app used to be good. But the new update limits how many likes you have per day and that gets really annoying. That's the same reason I got rid of tinder and why I didn't use hinge. Guess it's time to find a new app.
Sathya Narayan,"This is Masterpiece, I think none other app can stand to it. The only app with class and genuine people and with good user friendly design. I completely loved and indulged in it. Awesome app. Even tinder cannot touch this rare gem. Bumble you're the Master of all Dating and Community apps. I found many genuine friends within few days ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😘😘😘😘😘. Google, please give #The best dating and community app award to #Bumble. I recommend bumble to my friends. All the best. Keep goin bumble."
Arty A.,"I get matches on tinder and Badoo but almost NEVER on this app.. Probably had 2 matches in 2 years! Same profile and photos as tinder, Get tons of matches there but none on bumble. BUMBLE SUCKS."
Robert Owens,I can get 12 matches a day on tinder but not one in almost two weeks on bumble. If you get the 1 day plan it dosen't notify you that its a reoccuring charge and continues charging you everyday until you manually cancel it.
Lavaughn Conie,Second best to tinder
Betsy Oliver,What's the point if you can't see who likes your profile if you have too pay too see if I'm not sure I like this app at all kinda not worth my time I have better luck on tinder
Noah Thompson,Bumble has turned into another tinder clone where every feature and most matches are put behind a pay wall. Now there's also a me daily swipe limit and you have to pay to get more. It was previously unlimited. Also it won't show you people who swipe right on you.
priyanshu bhasin,tinder is much better
Zach The Guy,"Despite what the title and description says, it's just another tinder app that you have to pay money for, honestly there are better apps for making friends"
Sanjay Sudhakar,Would have given 5* if the price of the coins were priced a bit low! Otherwise better than tinder where you have 50-50 fake id's.
Got Marshmallows,Update: Constantly getting notifications for messages that I didnt receive. Or they're just fake notifications to open this app. On god can this app get any worse. Oh wait. You guys added bots like tinder did to try get people to buy premium. GG
Nupur Biswas,Better guys than tinder ♥️
Aritra Sinha,"Never matched with anyone in this app, even on Tinder ( free version) I got match but not on this app. Not a good app.. Thumbs down..."
Film Fury,"""You've hit the end of the line!- For today"" This app is a joke. I hit my daily limit of swipes...5 days ago. I haven't been able to swipe on anyone in 5 days. Total joke. So I have to pay $25/month just to use the app?? Nah. Ill go pay $5/month on tinder. Im deleting bumble"
F R,Horrible now they update the app. It says you have to wait 24 hours after you use all your swipes but then it never refreshes to new matches. You have to uninstall and reinstall to get the new potential matches. It was better when it was unlimited swipes like a few years ago....they are now a tinder wannabe
Mr Aquino,"Why do u guys lie to ppl ???? First it's been since December since I asked why can't I log in through Facebook like tinder ???? Sure u say send us a info on FB messenger but surely I have done that many times which never got a reply, so what gives ? Why can't bumble log in through FB? Why is it I sent numerous messages with my info and never got it fix since December? What other lies will u come up with ???? Even when u press the butting forgot password it doesn't work??"
Tracen McKinney,"The app was great until the most recent update where apparently you have to pay to have unlimited swipes. Having unlimited swipes set this apart from tinder. This is a big issue when living in a large city and there are hundreds of people within a couple miles of you. Bumble allowed you to get through them all, but now they're being greedy and putting up a paywall."
mink ra,"Waste if time. A poor mans tinder, on tinder you get 20+ matches a week, so far on bumble: 0... (2 days) would advise sticking to tinder."
Gaurav Chopra,"Its good, i am finding people and people are replying. It is better then tinder i think"
Daoud Mohammad,"Been using this app since it came out.... it's just way too expensive. Tinder gives you more out of $10-15. Also the super likes on this app are very low-key: many people won't even notice they've been super liked. So why should I spend my money on you, Bumble?"
vishnu prasad,Awesome app i think better than tinder
Cosmo Born,Higher quality app than tinder for meeting a like minded person
Paul Lyons,Awesome smashes tinder
Chris Hatt,Stupid paid 30$ and get no matches or anything this app is a fraud worst then tinder
Michael W Johnson,"This app is a lot like Tinder, and not in a good way. Similar design and visual focus. A lot of gamified features pushing users to engage more with the platform. Try Hinge instead."
PokeAlotaSmot420,"This app used to be the best around due to seemingly unlimited swipes per day. Since the new update it tells me ""you've hit the end of the line - for today"" when I've only swiped right 3 times this morning. Tinder, hinge and okCupid all seem like better options at this point. Formerly a 5 star app now barely 1..."
Phil Wattwood,"This app sucks. It goes offline constantly. I have to close and reopen the app after just a few mins of using (sometimes less). I see women I swiped left on 2 mins prior. The ""feminist tinder"" facade is a joke. The app is designed so women have to talk to you first. This means they'll say ""hi"" and expect you to do the rest."
Vince Pappas,"I like the amount of real matches an ugly guy like me can get. Tinder girls never match me, bumble already has 5-6 real matches ive chatted with. Not fake 1000 mile away match bait and switch like tinder does. Plus i dont have to be dumb and talk first and blow it immediately. Great job."
A Google user,"Fixes much of what is wrong with Tinder but still a dating app that profits from keeping you using it as long as possible. Plus, a bit buggy."
Merle Langlois,"This app is so pimp. I like how it has relationship goals and whether or not you want to have kids on there. The fact that women have to make the first move is okay on a day when you're feeling more trepidatious or passive, or just busy. People on here are more picky and more likely to state plainly what they are looking for. I heard it is more efficient for finding serious relationships. You definitely won't match as often as on Tinder."
Nathaniel Anderson,"Kinda like tinder, but way better"
T S,"it needs alot of improvement. Writing to the company you get a pre-written response. I bought the paid version to see who likes me so I could make my choices right away as online dating is a numbers and time game. I swiped on numerous profiles and matched and never got the pre-notifcation that they already swiped on me. you have to pay boost. atleast tinder gives you a free one monthly.Alot of times after having matched, I don't know they've sent the first message until a couple of reinstalls."
Lady Marac,Tinder with 🐝 stripes. Yuck.
Shane Chand,"I signed up for an option where I can see who liked me. Paid around $4 I think. But apparently they started charging me $4/day every day and I just wanted to see who my likes we're for 1 day. Then I tried to unsubscribe but there's no option in settings or account or anywhere. $80 down the drain for me. Who the hell has a ""subscription"" that renews every day instead of a longer period of time? Alot of other people had the same problem, just check on Google. And they won't refund me. Use tinder."
Kennyknows,"Far cleaner than Tinder. Feel free to define what i mean by ""cleaner."" Tinder is obnoxious af."
Stephanie Hartman,This app is better then Plenty of Fish and Tinder put together 🙂
Ryan,It's way better than tinder
Parth Patel,More responsive than Tinder. Good going!
Juan Esteban Álvarez Orozco,Better than tinder
John Handcock,"The fact that you are locked behind a pay way in order to have a better chance for your match to still ignore/not see the match in a days time is quite anti-consumer. And if your answer is theres a function that allows you to extend, no. You still have to pay for that. Now I believe that this app was created with good intentions, but given the nature of todays social climate and its predatory business practices, Its honestly worse than tinder imo"
Manuel Bartels,Excellent way better then Tinder
CAT HI B,Dating site where the woman pick the men. Better quality than tinder.
Sam Lee,"Between the poor UI, multiple swipe ads in a row, dumbass push notifications, and poor algorithms, bumble is the worse dating app outta the big 3 imo (tinder, hinge being better)"
Adapted,"UPDATED: So far I like this much more than Tinder. The added info most users include on their profile (height, political orientation, religion etc.) is really useful, and some of the prompt questions give a little more insight into the personality. It seems like a slightly more grown up Tinder, like what the OK Cupid app is trying to be. Only downside is the user base seems smaller, so it's a bit more difficult to find matches (for me at least)."
Brandon Reimers,"Better than tinder, just feels more true to how people are and a good way to meet new people"
Harry Atkins,"Better than tinder, helps actual conversations form"
John P,"If you are looking for relationships, Bumble is superior to Tinder. Also, if you are a guy who is dead tired of always being the one to initiate conversation, Bumble is superior since it's up to the woman to send the first message so atleast you know that they're actually interested before continuing. Is it as detailed as OkCupid? No, but it's more streamlined. Overall, I really enjoy Bumble and have had better success in finding matches that have led to something more."
Spencer Makale,Good app better than tinder
Michael Snyder,"""we support equality in dating"" actually no this is very sexist against men. refreshing all be it. but the women seem to not get the memo that they HAVE to send the first message because i matched sevral times and not 1 ever messaged, which is normal on other apps women want the man to take the lead but this app force a change in that polarity. but obviously either some one missed the memo or...... well thats just rude. maybe dont tell if im getting rejected? tinder dont tell me if they swiped X"
Nate S,So far it's been a nice app. Interface is a little nicer than Tinder. Distance setting is seem to be a bit off but nothing major.
Alex Ross,"Forcing a girl to speak first, gives a good standing point for the conversation, where as most lines guys come up with on tinder, just start a 5 minute conversation that goes nowhere. Men are afraid to say the wrong thing to the wrong girl. Women setting the pace shows the man what mindset to be in. If he can't handle intelligent dialogue he doesn't deserve you. Overall, good design. I appreciate it."
Aaron Farn,"I get some matches but they never message first, and if they do its inevitable that they stop talking. Women don't message first on tinder or pof, what makes the developers think they will message first when they are forced too. They don't even message first when they have the option. Paid for a month of premium and swiped right on everyone daily till i ran out of women to swipe on. Literally nothing changed with paying for the site. The only dating site worth paying for is tinder or zoosk."
Autodidactic Artisan,"Still hasnt gotten me laid, but unlike tinder im getting at least some girls messaging me"
Joshua Cassidy,"Just like pretty much all dating apps, Bumble replicated most of it from Tinder. It is an absolute joke, and I honestly think 95% of the women profiles are fake. You more or less have to pay money to have any luck meeting someone, and more often than not the first message you will get from a woman is something trying to data mine from you ... then you wont hear anything back."
Vaibhav Goswami,Much better than tinder.
richa ranjan,Better than Tinder but tends to be a bit slow when it comes to receiving messages. Or maybe it's because a very strong WiFi is required. Pretty good experience altogether.
Manu and Mamu,Fake app better use tinder over this app.
Justin Torres,"It's annoying to get notifications to swipe when I've been swiping...other than that the app is better than tinder but the subscription is pricey for what you get. Oh and you know what, I would like some app data like my match percentage rate compared to swiping Rate."
Shireen Joseph,"Bumble has people on there that's more serious about relationships vs tinder (uggghhh). It also gives women the chance to step up first and take charge. I like that it matches you with individuals who are like minded in the aspect of wanting marriage and children. Never paid for anything, didn't interact with creeps and never had an issue with notifications/ messages disappearing. Within 2 weeks, I met the love of my life. We just celebrated our 1 year anniversary. I'm forever grateful."
Neal Bachinsky,"Well, it's better than Tinder, but only marginally so. I like that it gives women more control, and the people I find seem to take things more seriously. However that's where the ""improvements"" end. Unfortunately they've gone the manipulative route that Tinder also opted for with their paid services. Issues such as people who like me are NEVER seen in my stack, the fact that I seem to get more likes with no subscription, or the ridiculous pricing of the in app purchases only warrants 2 stars."
Crime Master GoGo,Better than tinder..!! I guess...!!
Anthony Gonzales-Martinez,"Bumble is Sexist. I just now unmatch with women on the business platform or avoid swiping entirely because there's no point to try and network with them because they never ""message first"" and they just sit in my matches wasting space. In bumbles response to my review they even said they want ""equality"". Im sure a majority of people that work there are mostly women too. You feminists always want to pick and choose what YOU think equality is not what equality ACTUALLY is. Going back to Tinder."
Andrew Pasielko,"Light-years ahead of any other online dating app, even Tinder or Grinder for the queers! Flame on!"
KAARTOOZ,This app just wants you to fill in your credit card details. No potential matches found since a month of usage. Swiping right every single time ! And trust me I dont look like a murder for sure. Big waste of time. Try tinder though it works!
Roberts CL,"Doesn't function. Blank page for all 3 interests. Thought it'd be better than Tinder, oh well 🤷‍♂️"
0768 E.,"So far Bumble is just BLOWING Tinder out of the water, omg. The bios and pictures are a little weird to navigate but I'm 100% ending my Tinder+ and subscribing to Bumble!!!"
Michael,Good idea really bad app. Swipe like tinder (real creative) and hope to god they check their phone within 24 hours. Well some people aren't checking the app every day and then guess what. You can never get back in touch with them. Not to mention 90% profiles on here are fake.
MT Infinity,I got around 15 likes at one point on tinder while I only had 2 at most here. I like the idea but I think it lacks users.
Dan Angeles,Better than Tinder.
sean wendland,Better than tinder
James Bowdler,This app is garbage. They are collecting tons of data and building profiles of their users while also censoring what they think is acceptable for the internet. I never thought I would see a political correct version of Tinder but here we are. Don't waste your time with this garbage.
Me,"Don't pay for membership! Because as soon as you do, you won't get even a single like anymore. I already got several dozens of matches on tinder and cupid but not a single like on bumble. This is all part of their plan to keep you in the app, you've been warned."
Adam Bach,"Overall, this is as bad as tinder. The app notifies you of new matches, messages, and ""buzz is happening"" when there is nothing new and they just want you to open the app."
Natacha V.,"Way better than Tinder! Bumble matches my vibe more than Tinder. Let's just say, the Tinder culture is not for me."
STANLEY,I live in South Africa where bumble is not popular at all. Bumble is in direct competition with tinder who hide everything behind a paywall. So when you go to bumble you want to experience something better. you get the same thing but with less people using it. When introducing and trying to grow your app in a new country you should make it better and offer everything for free until it has enough customers to start charging. If im gonna pay for an app id choose tinder because more people use it
Nick Farrell,"It's gotten a lot better and there's a good chance you'll find success on this app...give yourself a good profile. Better than tinder and other apps, definitely worth a try :)"
Dostali Demokrati,"This site is just like the others. Stealing money. And no one, answering to you or LIKE. Don't use this app. It's just like Tinder, Taboo and others."
Matt Vanover,"Great feedback, beeline is way faster than tinder!!! Go baby bee's!!!"
Taige Zhang,Not that great. No matches. Prefer CMB and Fairytrail better in the USA. Tinder is better when you're international.
Matt Gingell,Better than tinder!
Paul Zuendel,"Once two people match. It shouldn't matter which party makes the first move. Literally kills the whole point. Bumble is just like tinder, but worse."
Cassandra Pierre,The app was basically like a mixture of Tinder and Hinge except there is less sexual conversations and the questions are not as interesting and easy to start a conversation. The messaging was glitchy and you were never notified when you got a match so if you didnt check your messages within 24 hours you missed the whole opportunity. Not to mention I matched with about 50 people and had zero conversations. What's up with that?
Masoud Zamani,It's not user friendly and it doesn't work. Tinder is better by far
Rowan Cooper-G,"Good app. Annoying that many women don't start a conversation after matching, so maybe there should be a different/alternative (as an option) mechanism than 'Ladies first'. Not sure why that's more about equality when that kind of sentiment is viewed as more chauvinistic these days, but it's a decent app and I'm seeing a lot more success+matches with decent ladies than on Tinder! Will keep giving it a fair shot."
Jon,A little more depth than tinder without being overwhelming. Solid experiences so far
Kyle Español,"This a great dating app. Actually, it is far better compared to Tinder! But is there a way to add a chat head feature in chat?"
Chris Marsh,"This app places men as nothing more then puppies in a factory line hoping for the woman to open the door, the fact that only ladies can start a conversation is rediculous. Tinder might be moving to a catfish and hookup hub but at least the playing field is an even one."
Elijah Pianka,Better than tinder 😂
Shelby Arcay,Have met alot of woman on this app which is great. But why on earth did you make a daily maximum like wack tinder. Had to increase profits eh? Annoying.
TARUN ARORA,The best dating app better than tinder
Vivek Patel,The app is awesome. Better than Tinder
Miss Maggie,"Can't look at more than 20 people a day before it tells you ""oop, that's enough! Wanna see more? Pay us money!"" Ridiculous. App is now useless. A shame since tinder is nothing but an absolute garbage fire."
PM photon,"Free ver. A million swipes and no dates. No matter the spread of parameters miles, age ect.. Shame has a good UI. All profiles are PhD's Masters ect. Yea right! Seem to be blocked from others seeing your profile I guess unless you pay! Huge waste of time. Go to Tinder much better now have a bunch of hits there."
Jeffrey Anderson,App works good. Seems to be a fair number of people on it. More oriented towards relationships as apposed to Tinder.
Brad Lindsey,"More serious, mature ladies than Tinder."
Juice Box,You have buy a boost to see your matches. Absolute B S. Just dont waste you time. TINDER is still ranked supreme!
Connor L,Better than tinder although the dating is rather odd. Idk if you need premium to see matches or what.
Head Office Rose Interiors,This app is so much better then tinder. Bumble don't have fake profiles so i will give bumble 10/10. It's free and it's real.
Samual Hyde,Trash....the fact that you cant message first....usually results in unmatches just use tinder in all honesty
Evan McCready,Tinder is garbage but it's still more useful than this pos app. Absolutely useless only 1 match in like 3 weeks and I know it's not my profile that sucks because it works decent for tinder
Kristian BS,"I've only recently started online dating for the first time and have been using Bumble for 4x months. It is my favourite of the dating apps (I'm also on Tinder, Inner Circle and was on Plenty of Fish). Bumble is easy to use and I've had a few lovely 1st and 2nd dates from it. The fact that the lady has to make the first move in conversation really helps as do small but important personal details like values, height and children. Hopefully something long-term will come from it soon!? 🙂"
Miguel Capistran,"Everything goes well, I like the different ways to connect people. But I miss the free super like that Tinder gives"
oankar chavan,Why 24 hrs limit after it's a match .... Just made it complicated .... So far tinder is best ....
Alfredo Serratos,Better than tinder
Rt Bt,Very fluid experience. I'm surprised at the number of genuine profiles which exceeds even that of tinder. I'm very impressed. The only thing that bothered me is the system of a match expiring withing 24 hours.
Shubham Rajwat,Nice app better than tinder
Bulldog,"Biggest crock of trash out there. Their premium service is an absolute joke, having seen notifications that people like me I bought it, but it doesn't show me anyone retroactively. Not to mention it's all dead profiles anyways. Also their premium is non refundable, so you can really tell what kinda gimmick company this is. Literally nothing but a cash grab. Save your money, even sites like plenty of fish or even tinder for god sakes are better than this pile. Run the other way!"
Joshua Passarelli,Better than Tinder. People actually talk. It's nice.
Nic San,"Dead-ass app, initiallly had many swipes then not more than one a week. Attractiveness level is mostly below 5/10. I suppose all the tinder rejects ended up here."
Micheal S,You swipe roght and maybe eventually get a match. Dont worry though girl has to reply first within 24 hours so pray they paying attention or its gone! Horrible. Just use tinder.
Seth Rappe,"Definitely the better of the big dating apps, especially over tinder in terms of accessibility while not having to pay."
Eren Bajracharya,better than Tinder
Benjamin Sebastian,Better than tinder. Women are more professional. The ladies first really give them a perspective of how we initiate.
Marcus Jenkins,"Dropping this to one star. Auto-photo moderation is broken. Can't upload pictures. Not many people on here, unless you're a woman after the extra features, stick with Tinder. Staff were rude when I complained about it showing existing Facebook friends."
Chris,Much better than tinder in almost every way.
Danielle Molden,Better than my tinder experience but I'm still new this.
Jonathan Enos,"I'd give zero stars if possible. There seems to be no activity at all. I get more matches on Tinder with less time put in, and waaaay more on Hinge. It's practically useless."
Johnny Sex,Better selection of girls than tinder. A lot more respond back
Millicent,Better than Tinder because they're more swipes 😊
Fajar Rizky,"much better than tinder because this app promotes women to make the first move, and you can almost guarantee that the pictures are real because they won't allow the ones without your face"
Juanplus1,Tinder with a dope verification system and a higher standard of woman and information on them. There is a bio no matter what which is dope to.
Bailey 2468,Tinder is way better then this app there is more ppl on it and ive had wayyyyyy better luck and talked to wayyyyy more girls on tinder but dont ever pay for tinder they will ban you for no damn reason
Aditya Narayan,Good that not free users also have a chance to match with people. Not like Tinder.
Dr Gasm,"All the same girls that are on tinder, but with a worse interface."
Derrick Eltz,I've gotten more matches and spoken to more women on tinder than I have on here
Audrey Cummings,"Constantly ""offline"" though I'm connected to WiFi. I have to either refresh the app(clear it from my app history) or connect to data. All my other apps are fine on wifi, I don't understand what is causing this and it's annoying. I like the app itself, I dont love that I have to message first evertime but I got mostly over it. The whole timed response thing doesn't super appeal to me, but it's what I get for not doing tinder"
Chris Dixon,"Bumble deleted my account for no apparent reason and refused to give me a refund. Also, when I would get a match it wouldn't show on the list and my messages weren't going through. There is other apps out there you people should download that actually works and free like Tinder, Tagged, and Badoo.. I highly recommend you download these apps"
Eva T.,Better than Tinder. People make the effort to write a bio. But there aren't enough people signed up in some countries.
Dylan Yeager,"Probably the worst tinder-esque app ever made. But hey, there's 1001 gender identities yay! Everyone can be individual and edgy! However, 1 star because my gender identity, ""inkjet 20330 power laser printer"" isn't supported here."
Franklin Slaton,"🤣😂😂😂😂😂 the fact that the owners of this app think people are actually going to pay for this like it's Tinder is hilarious to me. Tinder actually has a good reason to charge because it's a good app, Bumble not so much."
Jacob Schneider,98 percent of the women aren't real on this site. You might as stick to Tinder
JC Vela,"Less fake profiles than Tinder. One thing I don't like is that when you have browsed all the profiles in your area, it doesn't show you any profiles ever again, only new people here and there. What if you have a second thought on somebody or you're deadly bored and from all the available profiles you decide to go with someone you previously left swiped."
adrienne miller,Fancy tinder rocks
Richard Appleby,Having used Tinder and other dating apps for several years this is a refreshing improvement and puts the ladies front and centre #metoo style!
Nirhas Np,I like it more than Tinder
Terryis Hamilton,"This app is mostly junk. Incredulously low quality matches compared to Tinder, which I hate to say. Also, I hope you like this app using your insecuritues to try and milk money from you. 😉 I've sent a few emails about the push reminders using predatory tactics to get you to spend money and none have been heeded. Use this app at your own risk."
Robert Polmanteer,So far this app and the people on it are way better than any other cite I have scene. Tinder sucks this place rocks.
Jeremy Lee,"Better than Tinder, but paid features arent as generous as others. Good concept though."
Raman,Better than tinder and happen. Those are just fake and profit based apps.
Brant Racine,"Well, I'm garbage at being sauve or flirting with girls I real life. So I dont know why an app would help. But it does what its suppose to, meet with people in texting and the girls aren't as... easy..? As tinder since they choose whether they really want it to work. I give it 4 stars because I cant imagen bumvle bff or business are to popular"
Dominus Augustus,"Somehow, I am able to get over 50 matches on Tinder in a month, but barely 10 after several months on here. Most of the girls I match with don't even bother talking to me, or send me one message, then go radio silent. Don't waste your time and money, guys, this app is purely for women to get an ego boost."
Nishant Joshi,Still single but beats being on tinder
Donald Tharp,"Bumble is geared towards the quantity of users producing revenue rather than the quality of connection between users. If your picture makes anyone feel anything other than extremely happy, it will be removed. Dont plan on seeing any personality or creativity in pictures. Though physical and financial topics are statistically important in successful relationships, your account will be deleted if you respectfully address them. If you want personality or logic try tinder."
Mahesh Chandra Yayi,It's alright. Swiping isn't as easy as tinder
Snakes McGee,"Guys, if you thought this would be a refuge from the quiet desperation of Tinder, prepare for disappointment. Matches are seldom and conversations non-existent. Even on an app made for that very purpose, women will not message first. Edit: Also, just look at the number of replies to criticism that boil down to ""Sorry you've had trouble with our Support Team, please contact our Support Team."""
Nikolis Tary,Predatory AF. This is just Tinder with a new name. People hit you up to be friends but constantly want sex. Stay away.
Shauny Jaworski,"Met my player 2 through this app, because tinder blocked me for not reason, came to bumble and found him really fast"
William Morrison,"Rubbish app. Used it for 2+ years and never managed to get even a date from it. Girls can just match you and leave the timer to run out with no consequences and most do. Also it requires constant use to get likes as unlike tinder and other dating apps it won't show you to others if you don't. Doesn't take into your search settings either when showing you to others, so have had a number of likes which require setting changes to find."
Joshua Perez,"Seems like a lot of inactive profiles? I get on average 3-5 matches a day on tinder, but 1 every two days on bumble, same pictures and more info on bumble. And this is even when swiping bumble more than tinder. Just a hassle for nothing when tinder has more active people. Also girls are really bad at starting convos lol"
JOSHWillMakeIt,"Never match, Never get notifications of messages, and rarely have women send a message there once in a blue moon I do match. Been on a 100+ dates on 2019 using Tinder and Hinge. Bumble is where hopeless romantics go to die."
Laura Holmes,Tinder wrapped up as a bumble bee!
Habib Fanny,"As of 2020, with the filters that allow you to specify what kind of person and relationship you're looking for, with the steps taken to verify profiles, and with the large user base, this is the best dating app bar none. I hardly ever use Tinder anymore."
Neil Ledford,Tinder is better. Sorry.
Gavin Bergman,Way better than tinder.
jon woods,Found this really easy to use . Get a lot more match ups than on tinder .
jeremy bowling,I've really enjoyed this app. I've met a few nice girls. It also doesn't feel as cringey as Tinder
Sebastian Agreda,"Good app, the woman here are more beautiful than tinder"
Roy C,"So, so great for introverts. Better than tinder in my opinion but also quite different"
Parker Hunt,Better than tinder
Joseph Shape,Bumble is a bit more elegant than Tinder. It is nice to have women message me first. Not too many matches yet but I know it takes time.
Andre Rauch,You only have limited number of swipes a day like tinder
Jace Mullins,"Better than Tinder but not seeing as many results as a guy. Bumble is great, you can say way more about yourself and you can pay $3 for one day to test out their Gold Subscriptions. (They dont make it totally clear how to unsubscribe though, shady) Ive had Bumble for 2 months and have had 0 matches, however on Tinder Ive had at least 5 in that time frame. Personally, I think its because girls MUST start the conversation so that makes it more unlikely for them to swipe right. Thats just my op!"
Vanessa M,I love the face verification method and the way it separates BFF from Dating. Those two things really makes this app stand out against Tinder.
Noah Holt,"It is set up and works significantly better than Tinder. I'm a guy, and my profile seems to be treated with more respect, so long as I put some effort into it. With Tinder, it's almost like nothing you do matters in the tiniest bit, unless you wanna spend money on it. Even then, it doesn't seem like people use Tinder the way it's supposed to be used anymore. Of course, this app will still try its butt off to get you to spend money on it. As a rule, I don't give these apps any of my money."
Shlomio,A better tinder
Hi VLC s,"Maybe if they weren't so pressed to make money more people would first know about. And second more people would be on it. Most of Tinder's features were free when they first started. When you have become popular then you can start charging for features. It make sense why whenever I check Bumble it says, ""You're all Caught Up"" (No one to see)... Cause there are not enough people on it in most cities. Sad but True."
Aaron ATron9000 Clemons,I set my tinder and bumble profiles up identical. I'll get frequent tinder matches and ZERO bumble matches. This has been going on for months. I tested it by eventually just swiping every woman and still no matches.
Chris Dixon,"This is the worst dating app and is a waste of time. The bumble response team replies to all the thousands of negative reviews, only to fool you readers from considering downloading this garbage useless app. Do yourself the favor and save yourself the time and download tinder or meetme app which actually works and are both amazing."
Josiah Henderson,"Not that great. Tinder gives more matches, and the app is screwy I have bumble boost and planned on cancelling before the next renewal. I Logged out and went to log in on my new phone, it made me make a new account, I said screw it oh well, because I had gotten a new card since I made the subscription so I didn't think it would be able to charge me. Somehow it still did. They basically screwed me out of $50 just because their app sucks."
Daniel Fanelli,"So, I filed a customer service question about why my matches got suddenly deleted after I had a REALLY solid one, and never got a response. Then I suddenly got his by advertisments to rematch with my old matches that they deleted if I paid them. Now after filing my customer service issue I can't even log in. Tinder might be a crapshoot, but Bumble is a waste management facility about to erupt."
TheRabbit,Honestly this app actually works surprisingly well I'm meeting new people and not bots or people trying to sell me their premium snap I definitely recommend it especially if you tired of the bs with tinder or pof
D S,Fake just like tinder...no matches and a complete waste of time
Alex Styl,App is polished and I have found much less crazy people here compared to Tinder.
K T,"If Sharon Stone is using this, must be great endorsement. seems easier to use than Tinder, and more genuine response from positive hits."
Shuaib Kunji,Really liked the reception here. Just would like the feature of one free super swipe daily like tinder!
Edgar A,Like Tinder without the drama
Roland Wood,"Easily one of the best dating apps, simply because it forces people to message within 24 hours or risk losing their match. While unfortunately it has a lot less users than tinder, I still prefer bumble."
Andrew Stempel,"Mixed bag. No more ""control"" for women than Tinder, and with less information due to the excruciatingly limited text field in the profiles one can post. Like Tinder, contact isn't enabled unless there's mutual selection. Like Tinder, Bumble uses your location - SEARCHING, AND POSTING YOUR PROFILE, WHEREVER YOU TRAVEL AND OPEN THE APP. Bumble is worse because its response deadline compels users to activate the app while traveling to respond in time. Also, the ""backtrack"" feature does NOT work."
Josh Horricks,Dont send notifications stating I'm half way to a match but wont give me anyone to swipe on. Tinder trumps this app by a landslide
Nathan Benson,It's so far better than Tinder or Grindr
Aman Kapoor,"Make the about me section equal to Tinder, 500 characters or more."
D Mac,I don't get any matches on here. I'm pretty sure my profile isn't being shown! I get plenty of matches on tinder and facebook dating. this app is a scam. they hide mens profiles till they get desperate enough to pay money. Very sexist app!
Freedom Fries,The 1 day subscription will automatically renew itself and they try their hardest to hide the unsubscribe button. And if you had no luck on tinder don't expect anything more here.
Grant Evans,"Predatory Billing Tactics. If you sign up for ""One Day of Bumble Boost"" they will just bill you for it EVERYDAY if you don't realize they are doing it. Maybe it's in the fine print somewhere, but putting it small or on a TOS while advertising it as ""One Day"" is a predatory tactic. App doesn't have enough users in all areas, stick with tinder."
Pascal Horisberger,"Only been on a day or two, but seems a damn side better than Tinder."
Tacotravis,"Way way better then tinder. Tinder sucks, bumble is the way to go."
john kilburn,Awesome as Tinder
Sam Rasmussen,"Here's the thing. I'm non-committal, so could you make the app so it opens on a different person when you close it? Cause the only reason why I use tinder is because you can close and re-open it and delay your response to an individual... Just sayin."
Jill Colleen,"Deceiving... I did not intend to purchase 7 months all up front! They brake down how much it will cost per month, then charge for the entirety of it. So after meeting someone, within the first month (on Tinder! NOT Bumble!) I'm now obligated to have the account for an additional 6 months. WHY?! The app is for meeting someone, and now it appears as if I'm ""keeping my options open"". So does Bumble know something that I don't? Your app doesn't work? You're better off with Tinder!"
Dood Losangelino,"It's totally the same as tinder but I get better ladies.... No dates of course, this is L.A. but the banter is much better"
Epi Fabonan III,It's slower to get matches than Tinder.
Mikey Radziminski,This app is a bootleg tinder that makes you pay when you match. Not worth it. Tinder is way better
FilmGamer,I didn't get a real life date on Tinder (which I am banned from) but I got 2 real life dates on Bumble. 1 didn't go beyond the first date and a 2nd did but I wasn't in the right space at the time. After a while I complained to support I wasn't getting dates and what should I do? They gave me free Bumble boost to help. The fact that women draw first even if it is just to say hi makes a huge difference as men aren't forced to lead the conversation. One of the best dating apps out there by far.
Marvin Quitoriano,I like it better than Tinder
Mike H.,"This app is really pleasant & easy to use, and it's a lot easier to use than tinder. The majority of the people on here at least give you some information about themselves, because the app makes it easy to do so (I'm a man talking about women). The only downside is the smaller user base than tinder. Keep up the good work!"
Ramakrishna Rao,"Rewriting this again after an year of use, Dec 2019,still think its a waste of an app i have even tried premium membership, and let me tell you it's a waste. If Tinder is a place where gus simply swipe right to every single girl and cat fish. Bumble is a place where the girls just check the app for time pass and are just searching for something even they are not sure what. Sorry girls but it's true it's full of inactive users, and Bumble says only current active users within 1 month FALSE"
Peyton Frye,"I constantly get notifications that someone has liked me, only to go into the app to find that there's nothing there. It also keeps saying I'm all caught up with my potential matches, but a few hours later there's always more. I expected more from this app than just being Tinder lite. Waste of time"
P Rivera,Love that girls have to message you first lol. It leaves room to actually have a decent conversation since girls are so used to dudes always messaging them first. Had a couple of good matches and I like where things are going unlike Tinder. So good app!
James Baldwin,Much better than tinder.
Johnathon brushwood,Better than tinder thats for sure
A McD,Like tinder better
Abrar Aneez,"Biggest scam among dating apps. I had got 5 likes on my first day and swiped right for EVERY SINGLE PERSON, but still no match. I then expanded the existing age and range criteria to the maximum and even then it kept showing me that I was all caught up. After repeating the same thing for 3 days I bought the premium version only to find out that all likes were from people who were within 10 miles from me yet not a single one popped up on my feed. KINDLY USE TINDER. BUMBLE IS A SCAM."
RantChant 316,"Turning into tinder Jr. Fake profiles, people in other states showing like they are near you."
M Diaz,"Forces the updates. Tinder is not like that at all. Otherwise, good app. Only 1 star due to that technological aspect."
chrisssan,Too money oriented even more than tinder
Chicken Bowser,Better than Tinder.
Sven Kortjohn,Like tinder but more people looking for a relationship
Tiane Marie,Need to upgrade to do anything really.. If I wanted to swipe I would use tinder
Jacob Lorentz,"It's no better than tinder. Matter of fac, worse probably. Little to no matches whatsoever in 100 mile radius. Seems a bit b.s. to me. Waste of time of an app."
Vhs Vhs,Better than Tinder tho
pat y.,"For an app that empowers women to do the first move, it's pretty telling that most of them are not going to. Feels like a lot of inactive profiles or really not many people are active. It's a cleaner version than tinder but a ghost town. Your discarded pile gets reshuffled so you never run out of swipes. I have yet to match, I'll keep swiping until I truly exhausted my suggestions or passed by all of the women in my country lol."
Bands,Snowflake leftist Utopia dating site. Femi Nazis will have your account reported and deleted for any suggestive flirting or risky chat. I'm betting most of the women on this site are only interested in demasculinized men. You're better off with tinder or POF.
Kyle Laumann,better than tinder
Mj Benevides,I don't know what happened but having no limit on swipes is what set you apart from Tinder. Now it's been OVER 12 hours and still cant swipe. I'm over it.
2048,Below average experience and I've a date. Think it's time to move on. One odd thing i found out through out the time I've spent using the app is that I never had any match without making the first move (Tinder is better). The one good aspect of this app in my opinion is that there are less h*es than there is on tinder
JJ Davis,I had way more success on tinder and I was able to do things on tinder that bumble wouldn't allow like being able to go back and look at the previous pic whether you swiped right or left on.
Joe Russell,"Extremely low profile exposure. 'Boost' is useless, and 'Spotlight' grants you a single match that doesn't meet your age or distance filter. No free 'Super Swipe', unlike Tinder, so there's no reliable way to display your profile to a genuine interest unless you pay. All very expensive, and counter to the Dev's ideals, this app reinforces the stereotype that women only care about money. Nobody should have to pay to find love. Corporate greed at its worst."
Jesse Mcconnell,"I keep trying to put my picture up and it just keeps saying that it's an invalid photo even though it's a selfie I literally just took, tried deleting and redownloading the app... same thing, this is why people use tinder and not f***ing bumble... dont waste your time with this hot garbage and just get tinder, that's where I'm headed now, peace ✌"
Mrs. Vernon,"After using the app for 2 months, I can give a accurate review. Never has an app let you set up preferences and repeatedly match you with people outside of those. I read their response to a reviewer who complained about this and they said it was to give you the most matches. It is not about quantity it is pref. If I don't want kids stop matching me with people with kids. The app is becoming a polished version of Tinder. Even the BFF side is a bunch of women looking for hookups."
Jordon Borg,"buggy as all hell. tells me i have notifications and when i open the app, nothing. the money grab here is even worse than tinder premium as everything is far more expensive and they also introduced a gold coin system. the matches are better than tinder but the app overall is not"
Mitch White,Better than tinder
John D,"Women get matched with 50+ people. They try them all out to keep them around (due to the 24 hour match expiration) but only go with one. It's literally like shoe shopping, a modern day meat market, or reverse prostitution. This is just another failed concept that really only benefits the the top 5% most attractive people. Don't contribute to the further ruination of the social fabric of society. Find a better alternative. This is tinder 2.0. In disguise."
Andy Breman,"Ok app, better than tinder"
Danny Di'Niro,Better than Tinder but you still need to be pretty to get anywhere
Victoria Helm,"It's Definitely better than Tinder and way easier to find ppl who are interested in the same kind of relationship, but I have a cognitive disability and it's a little hard to stay focused on and the white and yellow give me a headache. I've yet to find any accessibility options as well. The usage and chatting, as well as meeting people are all really greatly done (not that anyone's talking to me. (But that's a personal problem lol.) If you don't have the issue I do, then I would 5/5 recommend it"
Joshua Daniels,"No matches for weeks, women are cowards. I know I'm not ugly or boring because I have 50 matches on Tinder. literally can't get matched when I swipe right on everybody due to how infrequently I find someone who will actually have the courtesy to message me. I find it mind boggling this app caters to women and even gives them responses to send out but they still won't approach you after matching and all I can do is watch the timer count to 0. Trash app for men"
Nicholas,"This app doesnt allow ""sexual"" pictures like tinder does and this is a problem. I cant even have a shirtless picture on the app, it gets taken down. So now when I match with girls, u cant tell all the time if they are chubby or whatver else."
M. A.,"Professionally data minined by others to find out that verification means nothing, most accounts are bots or employed teases of the company. Real people have thier pictures sold by other services like Facebook or badoo/blender/tinder/pof. It all gets used here to generate fake accounts. Don't waste money on this. Go outside and meet people. In response to the reply from Bumble, you are lying about not paying people to make fake accounts. You're platform is built on fake accounts."
Niklaus Petersen,Better than tinder.
Ethen Wise,"Told to be different from Tinder, holds all aspects but the good ones. As Bumble spoon feeds only few profiles at a time and only promoted times women are aviable. I ask for someone to be so kind in making a sating site that caters to a more male base. Considering it's harder for a man to get what he wants, than a women."
BarreLass Productions,"Actually, pretty good. Try it. Haven't encountered any glitches. The women are better than tinder."
lincoln licn,"Worst dating app for guys, it's a absolute waste of our valuable time. I used tinder and bumble with same bio, I got around 40+ matches in 2 weeks in tinder and 0 matches here. I don't use any socials, btw bumble definitely has a sucking matching algorithm."
Amitesh Gaurav,"More useless than Tinder. I know you thought it was not possible, but trust me, it is."
Jack Fox,Interface is better than Tinder.
Traci MacDonald,"Horrible app, can't message anyone Can't see matches, there were no matches anywhere, as bad as tinder"
Gabe Akiyama,This app is glitchy doesn't confirm pictures delete pictures that meet their criteria. its just overall a horrible app. There are other apps that are similar like Tinder that will open up much easier and confirm your photos much easier than this app does. Garbage app.
Mostafa Mo,"WASTE OF TIME I could not be more disappointed in online dating apps, especially Bumble. It's better than Tinder but still useless. Can't see who liked you unless you pay. Won't be recommend to anyone unless you pay. No one will know you liked them unless you pay. Without spending money, you won't get a date, even after spending money, you may or may not. NO GIRL IS WILLING TO SPEND MONEY ON A DATING APP AND THE ONLY WAY THE GIRL WILL SEE YOU LIKED HER IS IF SHE PAID FOR THE BOOST MEMBERSHIP."
Aaron Elliott,"I like the app so far. It's real people looking for real connections. I like that it has a separate space to find friends and make business connections. Comparing Bumble to Tinder, Bumble is hands down better. Tinder is good for shallow hook ups but it's also has alot of weirdos unlike Bumble. It does suck that the women has the be the first to message and they are limited to 24 hours to do so but it is a good formula."
David Aldrich,Meeting new people had been fun. Way better than tinder.
J. O.,"3 months of me using Tinder: got many matches, met several interesting and fun people, began relationships, and made new friends. 3 months of me using Bumble: not one match... Are there people even on here? Don't waste your time. This app is trash"
Andrey Drozdov,I like it way better than tinder
Naresh Kumar,"Compared to tinder, Bumble is not good enough."
That Dude,"For what the apps worth, it has a good set up. You can add more details to your profile and there aren't many pay walls all over the place like Tinder. Also I like the girl has to message first. The app is a lot more polished too. As for the people in it, it still sometimes has bots and people not even trying the app any more, but it isn't as bad as Tinder. Also there are more people trying it seriously in the app. Overall the app is fair."
Theodore HESSOU,"It's like tinder, but the better part is it's free"
Bernard Roth,Fake profiles fake people people trying to sell me bitcoins or or trying to get me to download some apps from China same profiles that are on tinder fake fake fake
hasan syed,"Best part: it verifies you are a real person. This app has better reputation than tinder. For 5 stars, i would want to know how many people rated me."
Spread Peace,Better than tinder
Jesse Torres,"It's a update drainer! You can't use the app without doing so at will! Other than that, it's a great app next to tinder. 🔥"
Taj Harvey,"I like this app a lot! It's extremely easy to use and allows you the freedom to choose, in depth, what you're looking for. It's a more mature approach to dating over Tinder."
Zev Vardeman,"It's better than tinder in that it offers more than dating but it's still the same old thing, pay to play so to speak and even then there is still no guarantee you will get a reply."
Eneas Núñez,This is the worst dating app out there. The worst experience you've had on Tinder doesn't compare to this app. Stay away
Kendra Sheets,Better than tinder in my opinion
Jay Krause,They literally force you to pay yo match up with people. Creators are thieves.Example: I've had this app for a few months and have 20+ matchs and have NEVER had a match yet. Use tinder or hot or not. Not this fake thieving app.
Steven Dicks,"Horrendous. This app used to be great. I had matches all the time. Now I'm lucky if I get 5 in a week. I'm not even horrible looking, but it seems that they either withhold matches or just have issues. I've had much better luck with Tinder and had 4 to 5 times more matches. I would not recommend anyone use this app. It's on the same level as POF now."
Ryeshia Farmer,"This app is awesome! Much better folks than you would find on Tinder, and has a more cashal nature than something like LinkedIn would offer. I also apprecoate the lengths that they go through to make sure that all parties involved feel comfy. I just wish the BFF feature allowed me to match with guys as well as gals"
Max H,Much better than Tinder.
Mdxfiend,Cant even see your likes without a paywall. Not even as good as tinder.
EVAN GARDINER,"The overall Concept in theory works but in reality it's not as successful as you would think as people are afraid of rejection... But my gripe about the app itself I've experienced more connection issues than any other I've tried including Tinder, OkCupid, POF and more. A lot less bots but there are still more than i would like. Need to improve the issue with resetting filters. Not liking the push for more and more paid features."
Adam Mason,Best £1.99 ive ever spent put tinder in the 🗑️ and get this. A proper app with respectful honest people on it.
David Mchale,Matches are rare. Some even randomly disappear when notification is given. Lots and lots of fake profiles. Just look at the names and the photo manipulations. App getting as bad as Tinder. Outdated and worn out.
Alex Morales,Better Then Tinder 👌
callum rooney,"Complete rip off of Tinder! Don't believe the hype, this app took all the bad points about tinder and made them worse!"
Capn Awesome,The top negative review is hilarious. Doesnt get dates so he gives it one star. Bumble works better than tinder for meeting people for me.
Faron Hartley,Shame they've decided to massively curtail the matches you're given without paying for it. It was the one thing that stood this app apart from Tinder.
Mouse Scarbrow,"Ridiculously ""woke"" and dead, and the timers rush you into either communicating or giving up on the person. Not a good method for people with a life. The app itself is useless compared to a browser. At least it hasn't become another whorehouse like Tinder."
Matter Stambaugh,"This app is borderline if not outright fraudulent. $50 and not a single decent match. I live in a metro area near a major university. My filters are broad. My profile is on point; no trouble on Tinder, etc. Glitchy, scam trash!! I don't expect a refund. But I ❤️ my bank and how easy it is to dispute fraud."
Taylor Wray,"Much more success finding matches here vs Tinder and Happn. Nice work, Bumble team!"
Pratik Dagaonkar,Nice app..better than tinder.
Paul Mushell,This app is more dead than tinder. All my matches I saw are not in my 5 mile range. I cant seem to get any local matches. I'm about done with this app. Tinder's cheaper too and I get a lot for my dollar.
Marc Stifelman,Better experience for me than OkCupid or Tinder. Happy to give women the initiative. Seems more relationship oriented.
Keith Keegan Durrant,"Not bad, better than tinder but not as popular."
Dylan Hess,Much better than tinder!
Patrick Sharrock,Got alot more matches on bumble then tinder
Dillon Miller,App is wonderful. As a guy its a nice change of pace. I have also had way more actual conversations then just one liners that lead to no where on this app. Also the messaging portion is pretty great to it's essentially tinder 3.0.
Maxwell Nelson,I like the idea. Better than Tinder over all
Christian Anastasiades,"Seems like a lot of people are outdated here and no longer use the app. Also, a ton of issues with untrustworthy accounts. Would recommend other apps like hinge for people seeking relationships. This is a lower quality tinder unfortunately."
miyah hayes,Bumble is like the more innocent but more organized version of Tinder. I have been using Bumnle for about a month now I really like the results.
Britany Nield,So much better than Tinder! Ha!!
Joan Quinanola,Way better than Tinder!
Yacob Yennett,"The app is glitching and forcing the ""backtrack"" option on every swipe, whether it's left or right.. This is without prompting the option at all. Hoping you can get it fixed as I've completely uninstalled the app and redownload it only to find the exact same issue. Using Tinder instead untill it's fixed.."
Ryan Jansen,I liked bumble because it didnt limit you like tinder did. Now youve put a daily swipe cap in place and become the very thing you swore to destroy!
Edward King,"The software is shocking. Right swiping isn't smooth, it stutters and sometimes even swipes off the opposite way to the way you swiped. This problem is not my phone or user (me) stupidity, swiping on all the other dating apps (tinder, OkCupid, Tantan etc) works perfectly."
King Rivers,"2 swipe limit? I literally downloaded the app and created a profile, i swiped left on the first girl then right on the next. Then i get a message that says: ""You hit the end of the line- for today!"" And then tells me if i want to keep swiping i have to upgrade to bumbleboost. Welp i guess i'll just stick with tinder then"
Matthias Stephan,"Good idea, good App, but does not do it for me. Other than tinder, you have the possibility to specify your height, but unfortunately not everybody does it. I swiped through many nice women that don't fit me. What I missed, was an option to add someone I like to a favorite list. I now have some women that liked my profile, but without some premium feature I cannot see who it was. 2 Stars because of the well made app, which is technically better than tinder."
Kevin Allen,"Tinder is better, so is Quickmatch."
megan brown,"I really love the app but can be a bit buggy if you are using data instead of wifi making it harder to read messages, I felt no need to ever use premium I feel you get more functions in free mode than you do in most dating sites like tinder but as I said can be buggy sometimes but overall I'm quite happy with my bumble experience, it is great it can take a while to get into good matches but worth it when you do."
Alex Allder,"If girls make the first move they shouldn't also see your images. They should at least be forced to pick based on merit or bio alone. Also, prepare to get ghosted. People match then say nothing and it's like Tinder all over again."
Robert Swift,Easier to use than Tinder. Know a bit more about the person your looking at too!
Stert Quarry Farm,"Easy to use. Good that females are in control of making the first move. Nice screen movement up & down, so that it is easier than Tinder to view people's profiles."
garrett albert,Don't get the 14 day subscription. I cancelled through Google play store 7 days in because I just don't like the app and they still charged me 54.00$. Their support is worse than tinder support. Truly horrendous experience.
Justin Norton,"Emotionally draining and superficial. I quit. I've done tinder and bumble for years but the results are minimal. The dating culture in these swipe apps is terrible. Girls get swarmed with matches while guys get only a few. The girls have so many options that there just rude and mean, while the guys get so desperate for a match they get needy and crushed when it doesn't pan out."
Jeffery Stanzer,"Being able to search by relationship style and distance is a great improvement over completing apps like Tinder, but there aren't many people on the app (meaning few search results), and those that are on here are largely inactive. As a guy, not being able to send the first message sucks, and all of my matches have failed to login within 24 hours and have expired. I made the mistake of buying Bumble Boost, which gives almost zero features and has q confusing interface (no tutorial)."
Aaron Merritt,Far better than tinder...
wizardinthenorthable,"Sometimes matches time out before there is a chance to respond, never sure if anyone I match with earlier in the week even sees it. Good questions, nice to be able to filter some things. Better than tinder, at least I can say that."
Gunji Otaku,"Apparently either I'm super fugly, awful human being, or the app has no real.humans in my area.. over 100 swiped right.. 0 swiped back... even tinder gives me at least one real reply after a short period .. maybe more ppl just use it where i live. All the people I see are super models, and clearly not after a relationship but insta followers..."
Yoyo Lee,Not as many profiles as tinder but much better quality of people imho (fewer ratchet chix). Too many inactive profiles tho. Not a lot of action here.
Coury Dorn,110% better than Tinder.
Ryan Lowder,"Terrible. I have used this app in the past and was very pleased. However, after going round and round with support and only receiving generic responses, I will sadly be giving this one star and deleting it for good. I would highly recommend Hinge or even Tinder over this app. I wouldn't give a penny to this company."
Darien Pratchett,"Love the concept. Much better interface than Tinder, no fake profiles (as far as I can tell)."
Alin Abs,"Possible bug.... please look at my account, I think its stuck at "" ran out of daily swpies"" I thought tinder did this, not you ! Anyway have a look"
Mickey Lennon,"Bumble is a great way to meet someone and a better option than tinder. I've struck out on both apps so far, but happy with the idea and concept of it. Well done bumble creators"
Jay Classic,Its a cool concept but bumble is greedy in their execution. I get matches but they never pop up when i swipe. Probably to entice me to spend money. I get way more matches on tinder. I bought the spotlight and whenever i use it they have the nerve to say it was a success when i didnt get any matches. Its not a terrible app they're just greedy. Go lie to someone else
Just G,"Keeps changing my photos round forcing me to have every one except the one I want as my fine, proper clunky slow app, with next to no activity in comparison to others like tinder, great idea, poor execution"
Arham Reza,Experience is not really good. I've moved to spotlight trail plan but only 1-2 matches so far which are their for either Instagram or do not initiate the conversation. Had many matches in Tinder though.
Kartik Monga,Worst app dont download..they just say upload new photos. Waste of time better go and downlaod tinder.
Francis Clarke,"I've had one person talk to me on here, which is one more than I had on tinder."
Mike JP,"On one hand, it's better than Tinder as you can better specify details of your ideal match (height, kids/no kids, etc), but having matches disappear after 24 hours means most women never get to their matches and it's up to the guys to extend, but can only do it for one a day. I get you guys are trying to make money, but that trips up the chances of people trying make connections"
Kelcee B,I truly liked this app until I get on it today under the bff option and I only swiped through about 10 people total (left and right) and it gave me a message that I've reached the end of the line for today but I can upgrade to Boost. Since when did we have a limit on how many people we could swipe on? I barely get any matches on the bff portion as it is and now all of a sudden I have to upgrade?? No thanks. I use bumble more than tinder for the exact reason I can swipe without limits. No $ 4 you
Blazing Gamer 3,"It was perfectly fine until you got a limit of people to swipe on. Waited my day to swipe and then had only 4 people before I've ""hit the end for today"" like that's really sad. Was much better than tinder for that reason and now they subsided to Money guzzling suddenly. Really sad."
Austin Suter,Was about to give this app a 5 star review until they started restricting how many people you can swipe on in a day. Id MAYBE pay for tinder but this app hardly ever works
Brittany Eubanks,Ok.. seriously? This app was better than tinder?? Even with the glitches!! Now you developers are limiting the amout of people we can see and swipe on daily unless we pay for more? I plan on going back to tinder.
Brandon Gacuzana,"I get the sense that for every person who swipes right on me, this app will show me 100 people who EVERYBODY swipes right on and are just insanely out of my league. I can't get a freaking match. Maybe I'm just ugly. Oh well, better than Tinder"
Brian McGowan,"Bumble is better than Tinder,with less scammers and insincere attention-seekers. But still,unfortunately,the majority of women on here will only say hello to keep the match 'alive' and then don't bother to reply,when they get a message back, replying to their initial hello."
Landon Michael,"Liked it better than Tinder, still, never met anyone off either."
Ollie Wood,"Made it night on impossible to cancel their ""daily"" subscription. Shameful opportunist cowardly and deceitful. Would rather use Tinder, because they at least make cancelling subscriptions straightforward and priced clearly."
Christopher Grant,Way worse than tinder and OKC.
Richard Crichlow,"Still Zero Stars. STILL no messages from anyone. Compare that to Tinder where I actually have conversations with women, and further compare that to OkCupid where I get dates almost once a week."
James Patton,I've matched more on here in a week than in 6 months of tinder. It's also nice not having to make the first move!
sereno,"pretty good, much better demographic and system than tinder imo but missing a lot of feqtures and they kinda shove the paid version down yr throat but whats new"
nikolas johns,Currently have tons matches on tinder but for some reason I have absolutely no activity showing on my bumble? I used to but now it doesn't show anything on my match queue
Dácotu,It's cool but unlike tinder you only get like one profile sent to you like every 2 days (with the free account). On Tinder you get a whole bunch.
Jonathan James,Was once better than tinder (Not hard I know) however. It's pretty much the same as tinder now.....May as well go to a pub and find someone the old fashioned way (with alcohol and poor decision making).
Matthew Castle,"At a guess, i would say that the number of matches I've received on Bumble is easily ten times less than on Tinder. If I were to base my self worth and attractiveness as inferred by this app, I would be better off leaving society and living in the wilderness until I succumb to my obvious deficiencies as an uninteresting human being. The only legacy i would leave behind is being the first person to die of bumble induced low self esteem. Two years, one date later, the forest is starting to beckon"
John Runnels,I prefer bumble to tinder. It seems like it's easier to connect with people who are looking for the same thing. Women messaging first makes the matches more meaningful and less about stupid banter
Alex Bradeis,It's becoming tinder regulating swipes and needs capchas since most aren't even active users. Accounts shouldn't show up if people are consistent and active.
Sagar V,Don't limit the daily swipe. Bad move. Tinder sucks for that exact reason. I'm happy for you to push more ads.
Luke Morrison,"Terrible app. Joked around said I was from Syria and they blocked me and kicked me off their platform. Racist, rude and nothing compared to tinder. Someone literally went through our conversation and saw ""ah Syria"" and blocked my account. Terrible racist nazi app. Never use. Tinder has more anyway. Sorry to the girls I was supposed to get a coffee this weekend. Guess Ill have to find a different way instead of this nazi app. No. Nobody is illegal. Your app just sucks."
John Windbook,Better than tinder 😂
Greg G,"Sexist...so essentially you have become what you dont like. Women rarely take the initiative to contact men as you dont promote this feature enough, and when they do..its simply ""Hi"". Guys get flamed if we dont open with a sonnet. And what's the point of men ""Swiping"" if we have to wait on a women. Might as well just post our pics and cross our fingers. Worse than Tinder as it pretends to be thoughtful whereas it just another site preying on loneliness...10/31..NICE A Canned Response. Notice that"
Pushpender Pundir,Didnt helped. Hated it. Tinder is 1000 times better
Henry Morgan,"Just overall much better than tinder, more useful featires, better experience"
Dan Louie Lizardo,Better than tinder
Mark Cross,"Limited likes, just another tinder... bumble used to be decent, not anymore. Avoid!"
wening ayu,Better than tinder
James Fischer,Don't use it. It is all around terrible unless you want to pay a stupid amount of money to possibly get more matches. Also there are some accounts that are almost definitely bots that seem like their just there to try and get you to use the app more. That's something scam dating sites use. Just use tinder instead.
Chase Robinson,It is like tinder on steroids love the fact that it gives you prompts on setting up your bio
Kyle Cherpak,"Its free, only have to pay if you want to, and has tons and tons of fjnds every day! Way better than tinder!"
Aaron Vera,Still better than Tinder
Seong Nam,"Remove the filter features, which is VERY limited if you are a free user, and this app is no different than tinder. The profiles are higher quality, though"
Walter Barta,"so much better quantity and quality of dating results than tinder! the ""girls first"" philosophy really saves time that would otherwise be wasted on disinterested dead end leads. 👍"
Alex Oates,Better Than Tinder
Juan Gutierrez,"Tinder, POF and Bumble are Scams. They send fake likes until you pay the membership fees to see you has liked you but all of a sudden you have no likes saved. Coincidence? No one actually ever messages you back if you ever do get a like or match. The worst part is these apps are almost entirely fake accounts. Steer clear, i had paid accounts for all 3 thinking it would make the experience better but it wasn't so. I'm hoping they shut downs these scam sites soon."
Ferf Zero,"somewhat more mature interaction compared to Tinder, but you get out what you put in I guess. Take the time to fill out your profile, take some flattering pictures- don't be discouraged if you don't hit a home run with your first match."
Justine Welfley,Great like it can't blame ppl for liking what they like. Much much better thn tinder.
froggy lad,"Great app for dating. Allowing the women to message first let's women think twice on who they swiped on, further allowing women to take safer steps towards dating. I met my current boyfriend on here and we wouldn't have met any other way. The amount you can share through bumble is so much more than something like tinder, which really helps you know who you're talking to. I recommend it to all my single friends as the men on here are much more courteous as Well!"
caolan campbell,Worse version of Tinder
Andrew Palmer,Just not Tinder
Richard Hernandez,Tinder is better
jonathan smith,It seems to be better then Tinder already. So that's good..
Meesh L,"F4M.Although I get a lot of matches , not even 5% of them respond regardless of customized messages. Trying to make conversation feels like an interrogation as I'm met with one or two word answers if I'm lucky. Some matches will respond once but then disappear so forget going on an actual date 😂 BFF isn't any better either. Matches will either not respond or disappear after a message or two. It's all pretty confusing. Oddly, I've had much better conversations/meetups through Tinder 🤷🏻"
Darien Goossen,Different than tinder
StepDaddySpazz,Fun. Good matches unlike tinder
Louis Sanchez,It's no mans land! Also they make it look like there are hella people on the app by showing profiles that you'll never match with because your outside their preferences unlike tinder. Also refused to refund me for a three month membership after I forgot to cancel my trail. Emailed support and no one replies. AVOID AT ALL COST!
Ross Ziskind,"It's takes too much time to see pictures.... Tinder pictures load faster, and instead of swyping down in this app, I can just tap in corner to see more pictures.... It's easier. But I like how only females can message first in this app."
Shehan Fernando,"For some reason this app works better than Tinder ever did for me. So thanks Bumble (and to the girls who swiped on me, doesn't work out most times but they were very nice, so I appreciate that)!"
Paul Pinto,App is good but women anyway are the same. Tinder is overcrowded hence it feels great to have 3-4 matches good. The tagline should be the same one eBay has - ' eBay/Bumble bcoz you just searched on Amazon/Tinder '
J A,"Although i haven't gotten a date yet, I like this app over others, and it's more user friendly than Tinder for example. The only thing i would complain about is the price for boost. But I understand it's a buisness so I don't mind it"
Jack Janes,either im ugly or this app is bad no inbetween not as good as tinder
Kirito Kazuto,Way better than tinder's algorithm if you ask me!
C.J.,"I love the quick facts and that you can filter by them!! And the fact that you have to converse to confirm the match, much more effective. Guys here are cute than tinder guys too in my experience. HOWEVER, can we please get time stamps on messages? Maybe a read receipt option?"
garrison barolet,It seems as though bumble has turned into the money gobbling scams that tinder and others have fallen to. Requiring money for unlimited swiping. Pathetic. Will not be using anymore.
Matt BenDaniel,"Bumble is missing a crucial feature that Tinder has. When traveling, Tinder allows me to swipe matches near my home location, as I'm looking for a LTR near home. Bumble is effectively useless when I'm travelling. I don't understand how product management can be so clueless."
Petra Nistorescu,"Decent app, decent people. Ita a step up from tinder."
Dmndz Designs,Not even worth it get tinder
Thora Eriksson,"Tinder is much better. I'm pretty sure most of the men on Bumble are super lazy & just swipe right on everyone. Matches rarely respond, which hasn't been an issue for me on any other app, and if they do they are often incapable of holding a conversation. I think it was an interesting idea to have women start the conversations, but in reality men are the ones swiping right on everyone without consideration. They should be forced to start the conversation & prove that they are actually interested."
Mad Blue Mage,Just another shity app. As many guys before me have said the free version for men is completely pointless and shouldn't even be an option honestly. I had high hopes for this app just turned into a worse version of tinder.
Chris PlagueScape,"OkC, Tinder, & even horrid PoF have gotten me dates. This app on the other hand after almost a year & spending money on it has delivered nothing. Fact ladies go first was a huge draw but even when you do match no one talks on here. I've legit seen girls with ""I wont message fist"" in thier profiles, so you can never talk to any one cuz ladies MUST go first & they never do. Change app so girls ""right swipe"" by sending message & only show guys the girls that already sent them a message."
new days ahead,Downloaded this and tinder at the same time yes I had faster response time on tinder but this app was more likely to have people I see every day so
Callum Sweet,"Excellent app, very regulated (which is a good thing). Women make the first move which saves everyone time in regards to interest and whether things can go forwards. Straight to the point and more stringent unlike tinder, also gives you the option of just looking for friends which I adore. Give this app a go people, you won't be disappointed!"
Gabriel Ramirez,More classy ladies than what Tinder offers.
Eike Modersohn,Gets me laid more than tinder
Jeff Martin,"Who decided to implement the absolute worst element of Tinder onto Bumble? The idea of limiting the amount of ""likes"" you are allowed in a day is absolutely absurd. That is 100% financially motived and is nothing but a negative for users. Poor choice, Bumble."
Gautham V,Abysmal experience.. Tinder is better by leaps and bounds
Thaddeus Burr,"*updated Oct 2019* Better than Tinder for two main reasons: They aren't trying to grab every penny in your pocket (yet), and currently it has a smaller and more serious userbase. The app itself is more comfortable than Tinder as well, in my opinion. HOWEVER, this app will daily give you notifications that ""activity is really high in your area!"" etc, when in reality it's completely untrue and only two new profiles are in your feed. This app's notifications are utter lies."
ruthvik chowdary,it's good... 🤙better than tinder 🤣
Carson Aprato,I like it way more than tinder
Mel Grosse,Better than Tinder
Prakash Singh,Give a try 🤔 was better than tinder
Jerreal K'hari,"You guys implemented this limited swiping feature on the app, and you keep telling me that I'm at ""the end of the line— for today"" after only swiping on 7 people. You were great before, but this new tinder like feature is horrible."
Joey St.Pierre,"Just wants your money, they used to be great let you get your matches without buying into a subscription Easley. Now it's just like tinder they make you wait and wait until.you get mad and buy in this app is awful now. It a shame people make something good then they get greedy."
chris sherlock,"Not bad, seems better than tinder to be fair"
Andreia Cozac,"I got banned for no reason, this app it's as teribile as tinder. Do your self a favor don't sign up"
CadMaheineken,I personally like that the women start the conversation. Its a nice change to the tinder setting.
zaskar30,"Nothing wrong with the app, it is the billing. I paid up till Jan 2020. Reinstalled, just noticed they billed me mo Ty several times. Tried to find a way to contact via their website. Nothing. Please refund all the monthly charges. You could learn from Tinder. It does not matter if you logout, close your account, or uninstall. If you go back on, have a paid subscription that is not run out, it automatically uses it. Thx for the reply, I am not on FB or Twitter"
Erik Gentzel,"Either the algorithm-matching system on Bumble is better than that of Tinder's, or there are just higher quality people here - either way my experience has been better so far here than on Tinder. Layout is very nice and intuitive which is a huge plus - probably the best layout of any of the dating apps in my opinion. Profile is probably the most customizable compared to any dating app. Would highly recommend this app over others if you're picky and looking for serious relationships."
Brad Elkins,"Pretty great. I dont know how it's better than tinder, but I think it's better than tinder."
Marcus Tham,"Horrible platform for males. You get matched with a girl, and most of the times than not, the girl doesn't even send you a text. Therefore wasting your time and effort. Some may even argue these girls might not even be the ones swiping right on you and might be a ploy to get guys to buy credits to extend their 24hrs match. Can't recommend using this app. Try Tinder or Happn, you'd have better chances there."
Jacob Anglin,"Why the hell do I have to pay just to see who's like me to see if we match. That's suck bs I'm never downloaded this again, -40/10 somehow worse than tinder. Change my mind."
Ash Wells,Actually prefer it over tinder
Dan Clack,Ok so far. Gotten more than tinder.
Diego Encarnación,Way better then Tinder.
Stephen Burton,Don't get the bots like Tinder
Steven Cobb,If there were more people It'd be better. Still a fun game however. Update : improving with time The concept is more fun than Tinder
Darren Hamel,lots of hot girls better then tinder
Benn Macleod,Terrible app. Nothing on tinder. The layout is just terrible to.
Jennifer Roan,I've only had the app 2 days and it's already better than 3 months in tinder
Jake Walker,Better off just going into a pub rather than relying on this. Unless I'm ugly (it's not unreasonable XD) I havent had a single date or even decent chat of 4 months of usage. A good side tool but shouldn't replace the real thing of meeting people. Pubs/bars are you best bet if you ask me to find somebody. Better than tinder though I will give it that.
Mele Nico,Was good until I got banned. No recourse in this area. Similar to Tinder judge/jury and executioner 😂😂😂. I suspect was salty women. These things happen. Wouldn't pay for this app however. I did send two emails at BubbleSupport but no response as well. You still haven't got back to me. So basically you say you will get back to me but that is to appease customer service however you don't execute. So pretend customer service. See the difference with Tinder is they don't pretend 😂😂😂.
Cheyenne Weber,"Way more in depth than apps such as Tinder. You can set up profiles to tell people the little things like height, are you a smoker, what you are looking for and even your religion. It's nice if you are looking for a relationship to be able to filter people out before swiping! The only negative thing is having to pay for super likes or boosts. But I wouldn't choose any other app over this one. I also find the idea of bumble bff cool too (looking for friends not dating) which you can switch to"
Vincent Maverik,"Absolutely useless. I bought premium cause I had 3 matches and it didn't let me to see them until I upgrade. After upgrading they disappeared. I have swiped over 1000 girls and I was getting only ghost matches that have expired with time. Extending time - useless. After premium ended I've received a message that I have a match, but I have to upgrade to be able to see that person. Services like this should be removed and managers should be prosecuted for fraud. P.S. I had success with Tinder."
Blackdust09,I liked the friends version of the app and the dating app is just as good just wish there weren't so many bots. Still better then tinder.
Miggy,Better than tinder
James M,Less shallow than Tinder
Daniel Kehoe,Better than tinder
theo feel,"worse than tinder. The first week you get matches. but after than it's total silence (your profile is not new and they do a poor job bringing up old profile i guess) even with the premium subscription. I guess they want you to pay more by using the 'spotlight feature'. That should be included in the premium somehow. But anyway, worse experience i had in a dating app i give them 1 star because i like the concept"
Eric H,"Pretty good. I'd prefer if they had passport like Tinder. Also, if someone swipes you, you have to swipe on them. If you swipe left, you wont see them again l. I'd prefer their like be saved and I choose when I want to match"
Paul Los,"Ten times better than Tinder, for men AND women"
Kyrie Nicole,terrible i just found a match then it disappeared it wasn't even next day yet funny they don't want you to get matches for free. But want you to pay for it same as for tinder smh
Matthew Craig,Better than tinder
ALEX,Another Tinder clone
Max Paulus,"Great App, better than Tinder"
Jacob Lindsey,"This is just a tinder ripoff. Only difference is that guys don't get to say hi first. Too many fake accounts. It'll tell you that you get 10 likes a day but won't show you unless you fork over the cash. Then if you pay for the premium suddenly the ""likes"" stop. Just stick to the other apps, your not missing anything here."
Erik Edmonds,Pretty good quality matches! Much better than tinder.
Daniel Johnson,"They hide matches just like Tinder, and then when you do pay for the premium membership, it turns out that they are 100+ km away and are inactive or bot accounts. Such a waste of time and money."
Dylan Hauke,Beats Tinder in about all aspects
SODUCCM !!!,Either the profiles are fake or it's someone looking for a sugar daddy. This is worse than Tinder. I would say maybe 15 percent of the profiles are real. Low score because they allow girls to solicitate relations for money.
Will Marcus,For someone that travels frequently not being able to force a location is a problem. I'm interested in singles at home not on my travels. This functionality turns this into Tinder....
Karen DeGrazio,Worse than Tinder
D F,The women on here are better but now it makes it harder to get a match because not only do us guys have to wait on the woman to say anything. ...the unlimited swipes right are limited. ..super lame bumble...aka binder...tinder and bumbles updated baby
Preston Rodriguez,"Boooo, don't upgrade your app!! The app said update to check out new features, so I update and now all of a sudden bumble limits your swipes like Tinder. No reason to really have this now if it's the same as Tinder"
Eric Allen,Been on a long time I paid for Boost and Spotlight but I didn't really see any effect. I didn't get more matches and the few matches I got over the month and not a single one messaged me even I extended the time. That tells me they're bots which is something I've suspected for a long time. what's the point of making it so women message first if they dont. I get like 4-6 matches a day on OKC and 1-2 a day on Tinder. To only get a handful in a month with paid service... definitely not worth it.
Dayne Williams,"While I like the concept the truth is nobody uses this app, it is completely dead. A couple years ago I checked it out, waited for it to pick up but it has still not progressed. Tinder is way better."
1968 ęčľűď,Update is a step back in terms of improvement. One of the few things you guys had over tinder and you guys deliberately removed it because of greed.
memes 543,"2.99$ per day, thats an outright scam it should have a free trial to get matches and talk with them. Whats the point in having the app if you can't even talk to people you've matched with without paying a day, week (i can understand paying in months like tinder) there should be exclusives. Like chatting is free but sending pictures and video chatting is for premium members. Ive only used this app for a day....dont like it"
Seb ThessT,Works alright. A bit better than tinder I guess.
Jason Bennett,"Waste of time. You won't match anyone unless you are willing to pay extra. NOT FREE, PERIOD. Stick with Tinder, free and as advertised."
Richard Gelish,"This is basically tinder with extra steps. Still sucks, women here dont actually want to meet up just like all the others. Also they cut my subscription short. Mine was supposed to end on the 26th per the app, but it ended on the 25th instead. Never using again. Bad business here people."
Logan Dihel,"Higher quality profiles than tinder, but wish I could add more than 6 pictures"
SomeRandomGuy,"Seems pointless. 3 weeks on Tinder and I have 20+ matches, on Bumble? 2. And one didn't bother to message. Got a free ""Bumble Boost"" and it made no difference, so whats the point? Pay to lose."
Erin Hill,Might as well be tinder.
Ryan Fisher,"Good for finding a deeper relationship than you may on Tinder. Although, to be fair, fairly similar as a lot of women on Tinder are also after relationships. TL:DR Good for long term"
A. Julian,"The best dating app right now, but still has some flaws. Three preselected characteristics are displayed in varied order from profile to profile and for the free profile, the people out of range who swiped right on you never get shown to you, but are still displayed in your queue of people who have liked your profile which is annoying. Still, this app is preferable over Tinder, Hinge, and OKC, which I've also used."
S inSF,"STAY AWAY! WASTE OF TIME! It is obvious the Bumble techs have quotas and create too many fake profiles along with the other spammers here. Bumble is worse then Tinder in fact. In fact, if you report the many prostitutes /sugar babies, they will in turn report you and get your account flagged Seems clearly Bumble needs anyone they can get to use their app and will allow the many spammers over real people."
Justin Geisler,"I think this is a great concept and the people seem to be MUCH classier than some of the other apps I've been on. However, I wish they would incorporate a daily free token or something like Tinder does with their free daily ""Superlike"""
madlarkin8,"I deleted this app since it got really political. It started dropping BS notifications about climate change and progressive idealogy when in reality its just an app for ""dating"" You want to fix toxic masculinity and heal the planet? Go out of business. Dating apps have streamlined all the humanity out of the modern relationship, if youre here for a hookup, its better than tinder since it weeds out the nonresponsive females but if youre here for a real relationship save yourself some dignity."
Florencio Ontiveros,"It's better than Tinder, just waiting for my first date"
Idole Lydia,The people I've talked to here are different from Tinder. It's a good Thing that the app has the option to say what you are searching for in the bio. The free version is perfect no annoying adds which I am very thankful of.
pferd,"My experience with Bumble, even through subscription is the worst dating app I've ever used. In comparison to Tinder, Okcupid, and the new Facebook Dating, this has to be the sketchiest service I've ever had. I deleted my account months ago, and yet since then, they keep trying to charge me for a subscription. To further validate this, I've deleted my account through the settings where it asks you to type ""delete"". I've got a refund last time they charged me, and now I'm being charged again."
Ubong Chusom,"The app is not bad when you look at the quality of ladies and its various options for selection like religion, zodiac and intentions which makes it better than tinder and POF. But, the payment plan is funny, it's like you are forced to auto-pay once you activate your first payment. I opted for a day payment for trials but cannot find where to cancel it and the app does not show up on my Google subscription page for me to cancel it. I need to report this to my bank then."
Mr Sylvester,Its slightly better than tinder
Howard Lin,"a bit sexist that women get all the upper hand on this app. only they get to message you first, you can't message them until they initiate. had tons of matches, 99% of them either don't say anything or only say ""hi"" once just to keep you in their queue. it feels like this app is built mostly for women to build up their self esteem and rack up matches to boost their ego or show off to their friends. the only thing that this app has over tinder is that there's no swipe limit."
ZaniOfdallas Harper,Great app better then Tinder.
Mayank Sharma,The new upgrade has resulted in limit on profile viewing. Unlike before. That's not done by Tinder. I am not really fond of these cheap tricks which are done by B-grade dating apps. Not interesting Bumble.
figo nacci,Pretty good I've had lots of matches for just being on for a week and a day I've already been on a date with a cute girl. Lots better than hinge or tinder .thanks
David Hnilica,"Tinder, but worse in every respect. Fewer people, more complicated (matches disappear automatically, way too pushy) and more expensive (Tinder at least gives one free SuperLike per day). Also, the free premium for 14 days is a scam (useless and renews automagically for 3 months). One star for at least giving an option to fill in the basic info (height, smoker) in a tag, instead of having to use bio...."
Kyle Fall,Better than Tinder IMO
Scott,"Was good until they introduced the daily swipe limits, hiding more features behind a paywall, no better than tinder now."
Better Days Sanctuary,"You know, the women on here are the highest quality that I have seen on any dating app especially when compared to Tinder. The only thing is the business practices of Bumble seem to be a bit underhanded at times. For instance, they actually don't show you women who have liked you in the normal swiping option in hopes that you will pay extra in order to see these people. If you do pay extra, it will be over $20/mo which is a bit crazy. Would really prefer ads instead of withholding matches..."
Matt Ramadanovic,"Far fewer fake profiles then tinder. Women centric approach minimizes casual swipers and penpals. Thr problem is that most women lack the desire to message first. Desperately needs a ""ok to message me"" option for women. It also needs location filters for those of us who live near bodies of water where someone 5 miles away could realistically take 2 hours to get to."
Ryan McPherson,"A worse version of tinder, with few real people."
Kalari Faultry,This app is pretty neat. Idk if they use an algorithm to get ppl closer to your intrests. I find myself swiping right more often than I did on tinder.
Austin Little,Way better than Tinder. Less bots and more classy people that aren't just looking for hook-ups.
Dan C,"Good matches, but most looking for LTR not fun friendships even when they select the ""I don't know"" option for relationships. It seems to have mainly profiles of more professional/upscale people with discretionary income to travel as shown by their selfies... It is better than Tinder, and a much much better than POF and other similar dating apps."
Simeon M,"Having the girl message first isn't a bad idea; however, most of you matches will match for no reason and let the match expire. I am a decent looking guy with a lot of personality traits and yet I have only had about 7-15 matches on bumble while using it for almost a year and maybe 3 of those matches actually sent a message. In comparison, I had over 14 matches on Tinder in about 4 hours one time, and half of those girls responded. So I think bumble should reconsider its algorithm."
Eric Bruns,"Better than tinder but filters need a major overhaul... For example selecting a for for ""don't want children"" will exclude anyone who didn't put anything; an option to exclude people who either have or want kids would also be nice."
Matthew Buck,"so far, better than free tinder or free POF. I also really like that it takes the pressure off of the guy to come up with the opening line. Plus, the dates that I have gone on from this app have all been pleasant and I have not felt like I was just being used for a free meal. Thank you Bumble for making the best dating app that I have found so far."
Mey Delicatta,The guys were all sex crazed a-holes. If I was looking for sex I'd go to goddamn Tinder!
Sam Marsh,Proper sick way better than tinder
A. LuisDiaz,"Every day I have notifications saying someone wants to meet me , but it is always false. Tinder is better and that is an awful app too."
Wilfredo Valle Jr,The best dating app among Tinder and Hinge in regard to the application's design and organization. Though I feel it should be a paid only app as it's free use is just someone's waste of time waiting for the rare chance that someone swipes right on you after you swiped right on them. The amount of time it would take for a match to happen that way can take so long that you delete the app or account before the other party gets to stumble on your Bumble and MAYBE swipe right. Gets discouraging fast.
Phil Briggs,"similar app to Tinder although Bumble's main appeal, which sets it apart from Tinder, is the requirement for the female individual to make first contact should the pair match initially. So I like this feature"
Torey McAvoy,The app is easy to use and in my opinion better than tinder. The only reason I'm not giving more stars is because most of the time when I swipe right they dont show up on the conversation tab. If they dont show up how am I supposed to talk to them? Pretty frustrating
Jordan Hockley,At least its better than tinder 😂
Alexander Miller,"I didn't realize until I signed up that this app also works for gay men! Lots of really great guys on here, people respond far more than on Tinder. If you want guys serious about dates, you may want to check this one out"
Jace Pugh,Terrible. Signed up for the free 3 month trial then was charged $50 a week later and so far they have refused to refund me my money. Don't use. I also experienced lots of glitches such as messages not sending when sent and not being notified when I received messages. Plus there arent lots of people using the app so the chances of matching with someone in your area is low. Going to delete the app ans everyone else should do the same. Use tinder.
Austin Wesolick,"If it wasnt for the ridiculous cash grab tactics this might be a decent app. But riddle me this why is it that I'm ""all caught up"" on bumble yet there are 5-6 people who've liked me but I cant see them or swipe on them unless you pay for premium? At 10$ a week? This app is a step above tinder at best and the fact they're hindering people from meeting one another for money is absolute trash."
Beck Bingham,classy tinder
Nicholas Hale,Like Tinder but sexist and with a time limit to talk to your matches! :D
Andrew,"Like it better than tinder, haven't gotten matches on either but that's probably just because I'm ugly"
mini blue,I just tried to install this app. Doesn't let me put pics which I want & use my gallery on it's own. There is no customer service.all shite . Make it simple to use just like tinder.
Wally,On android the app constantly mis-swipes. This never happens on any other dating app (such as Tinder) and its frustrating. It's as if the app is randomly and purposely amplifying random profiles swipes whenever it deems it necessary.
Marco Polo,Much more mature than Tinder
Timothy Soto,"Get way more matches on tinder.only ever got one match, its designed to just keep you swiping endlessly without matches. I think the profiles are fake or have been inactive for a very long time."
Nick Kennedy,"The app setup is decent, kinda laggy. Was using bumble for about 4 months. Had very few matches and the ones I did have never talked. I even plaid for some coins and still nothing. Overall the app was a pretty big waste of time. Even tinder is better."
A R,This use to be a great app but now it's a Tinder hybrid:/. Most of the men just swipe right without even looking. Please clean the site up and put men in the back of the line or delete thier account if you see they are mostly swiping right then deleting after a woman swipes right and says nothing to us. So lame. The filters don't even work to help a woman out.
David Ritchie,Nice app better than tinder
M A,Better algorithm and quality of women than tinder
Joel D,"Better than Tinder, less seedy and much more thought put into the app build. Works great."
Richard Lubbe,Better than Tinder in my opinion. Although it's still a bit too expensive.
Tim Hersh,"Tinder sucks after a recent update. I can barely match with anyone on their new algorithm. I used to match with many more girls on Tinder vs Bumble, I use a very similar profile on both. Now I get way more on Bumble so I'm here."
Ryan Toomey,"App does NOT work. I literally spent hours swiping right on hundreds of women, but nothing happens. There is no way to actually communicate with them. When I go to match queue it just shows blank circles day after day, there are never any matches that show up. I even changed my pictures and profile and still nothing. This app is a waste of time and a SCAM! Heck, I got better results on Tinder than this."
Charlie spink,Much better than tinder dont know why people rate 1* obviously they dont get matches for their bios or how they look but ive matched some proper fit girls and met loads 10/10 thanks bumble!
Cindy Bojorquez,Can't cancel my account. This is why I use tinder >:(
Justin Erickson-parent,Way better than tinder
sarab Hayre,Great way to meet new friends. Better than Tinder!!
Arthur Ballesteros II,better than tinder? alternative
Patrick Bardin,"Too many inactive accounts or bots. Completely pointless for people actually looking to meet others. If I wanted to swipe with no result, I'd go to Tinder."
Brad Wunderlich,"Really like the UI, much nicr than Tinder. Just wish you could write more in the bio. Its hard to write sometjing creative about yourself in such few characters. And sometimes it wont show new messages until I force close and restart the app."
Prabal Singh,BETTER THAN TINDER. WORD.
Kyle Linton,Pretty good. Better than Tinder because it doesn't have as many insta:fakers
Philip Atkinson,"Great. I got many matches. Nice, pretty and smart women. Better than Tinder. Maybe women feel more emboldened when they send first message. Guys? Get good pictures."
Jon Edinger,"Head and shoulders above tinder. Very few bots, no ads, reasonable prices for upgrades and the way the app is set up encourages better conversations."
Leonard S,Excellent. Better than tinder
Tyler Wrenn,Too expensive. Tinder does better with their premium subs than this app. At least you guys have less ads.
Scot Hanson,Best dating site. Better than Zoosk or Tinder
Shiv SV,"As much as I don't like Tinder, this app is better deaigned for dating"
Thomas Kutis,"So far this app has been way better than Tinder. Not sure why exactly, but it is."
Pieter Léon Vermeersch,Much better then Tinder
Harsh Shah,Better than tinder
johnny dollmaker,"𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝗹𝗮𝗶𝗺𝗲𝗿: 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗶𝘀 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗽𝗽 𝗶𝘁𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗳 𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝘆 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗜 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝘁 𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗸. So, here are my thoughts. I really liked this app's UI, though I think the developers should've made the text chat more detailed(TIMESTAMPS, delete option for messages) and worked more on INTEGRATION. It's the one thing that makes me tick, and although you guys do a better job than Tinder, not everyone uses Spotify and I think there are better ways to have music be something on your profile. One thing I'd love to see in the app is a book integration of some sort(Like Goodreads or something) or a movie/TV integration(Like Letterboxd or TV Time) 𝘏𝘰𝘱𝘦 𝘺'𝘢𝘭𝘭(at Bumble) 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘳𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘦𝘸"
James Oneil,"Tinder knock off. Not for me, not ever. You have to use location services and I travel on the road a lot. I don't want to meet someone in po-dunk Mississippi. I want to meet people where I live. It's useless unless I'm home. Deleted in less than 10 min."
George M,"My standards aren't high for a dating app but this one is inferior to the other top ones in terms of getting people actually talking to each other. In the same time of use you'll at least speak to 5 people on Hinge, OKC, or even Tinder. One extra star because swiping isn't capped."
A Google user,"Rubbish, couldn't set up a profile as a picture of me isn't an actual picture and kept asking for more. Will try Tinder instead, heard better things"
Leo Carnes,"Lies and fake pictures. Used humans curiosity to keep addictive and in hope of being real. Never sent your ""type"" only pics of fake accounts. Bumble, Match, zoosk, Tinder, Meet Up are all fake ass people. Lies to you!"
J.P.,"Swiped right every day for a few weeks never got one match. It also constantly notifies me people have liked me but then I still dont get any matches so its either lying or hiding them from me. This is not the first time I've tried this app I used it a few years ago and had similar results, I will definitely not try it again. Avoid this garbage app try tinder instead."
Tyler Shelton,"I use 3 other popular dating apps and this is the only one I run into a match wall on. As in after a certain time frame I stop getting matches, while such as on tinder I still get matches after using it for over 8 months. Whether it's to get you to sub to the premium service I am not sure. I do get about a week of matches from bumble though"
Denver Johnson,Way better than tinder!
Jack Ziegler,Tinder is better.
Loni Odenbeck,"I find this app more difficult to meet people, due to the time requirement to respond. Tinder has been much more productive to meet people."
Michael Constenius,Just works. I've never had any luck with tinder but bumble always works to find interesting worthwhile connections.
Duncan Williams,"Read a few reviews and be very careful with your card details!  Bumble seem to routinely apply the same sort of scam - a ""one-day"" subscription or similar which repeatedly bills you - day in, day out. The charges are small enough that you may not notice.  The worst part about this is that they will  send push notifications saying ""you haven't logged in for a while"" etc, (making it sound like your account is suspended/invisible/stalled), all whilst they continue to charge you behind the scenes... guess what, the push notifications never say that you have unwittingly subscribed to a lifetime of per-day charges!  Support staff are unhelpful, unwilling/unable to resolve.  Stick to Tinder or OKC.  EDIT IN RESPONSE TO BUMBLE BELOW: As with all your other responses, you try to look like you take action but your support team do nothing. You've avoided the main complaint here - as have your support team - the *misleading push notifications* sent when you know the account is not being used, which make it sound as though the account is inactive whilst you continue to sneakily take people's money day in day out. BTW support took > week to respond accurately on simple billing issue: dates!"
Tyron Duncan,Better than Tinder
Eltomo,BEWARE the App likes to lock you into a 3 month contract then charge you close to £50 for the use of its basic services. Better off using tinder less likely to blind side you with tactics leading to extortion.
rickie vidito,Like the app but never get any replys and you need to pay to put out a spotlight on yourself or to reach out as a guy. Only other complaint is not able to add filters for age or who we whant to meet i dont want someone who smokes to show up for example or 18 year onld girls when im 23 about to be 24 even 19 years old is weird but that might be just me. Great app overall tho beats tinder.
Lil Bill,Tinder's better
Aviv,That's even worst than Tinder and Tinder is a freaking bad app
Pub G,Less matches than tinder and then on top of that the whole girl go first things makes it virtually nil with matches
Zack Paleias,Intrusive app permissions. Garbage customer service. Maybe 10% of the userbase of Tinder. Waste of time.
Zachary Daniel,"Terrible app, seems great at first, but then you realize it's an utter waste of time and effort. Dont worry about getting matches unless you pay for them. Seriously next to impossible to get a match without money being spent. Customer support is an absolute joke, there is none. You just get an auto response here and there. Total lack of care, except for your money. Honestly tinder is way better, and that hurts to say.. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE! 10/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
Jackie Parrish,Dont waste your time. It's the new tinder apparently
Matthew Tyus,"This is my second try with bumble, and it's still horrible. I have a Tinder profile with the same pictures and bio and get dozens of matches. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS APP"
Daniel Brown,"I get a lot more matches on here compared to Tinder, OKC and etc. It's a good app. I recommend."
Tony Pan,"I have Bumble Boost and Spotlight, I matched with people before I purchased those items but did not receive any likes after. terrible customer support and totally useless service. Don't waste your money on Bumble, there are way more users on Tinder."
Dimitar Popov,More bots and un-responsiveness than Tinder. Don't even bother.
User Account,"Waste of time. I get matches on every other app including Tinder, CMB and Hinge but not Bumble."
Sean B,"it feels like a much better interface than tinder, i havent used it long enough to speak for results long term but the results seems better as well."
Alexander Koch,"All the work of Tinder with all the complexity of other dating apps. Matching is a chore, and even when you do, the matches only last 24 hours. Thus if your date is offline or off the app, you have to pay to extend it. Not to mention, they have a worse premuim version than Tinder+. Overall, its a subpar dating app with little user friendly assistance."
Heet Shah,They have a weird paying subscription of different feature into coins. Either make it all one or just do it away with. The 24 hour expiration on matches is ridiculous with blatant sexism of letting girls reply first. You will never get matches that reply in that span and its worthless. Tinder is much better even if profiles are bad.
Mark alderson jr,haven't had much luck with this site but still better than tinder.
Lawrence Lindberg,Better than tinder!
Cole Domenico,Quite a bit better than tinder. The community seems more serious about meeting up in real life which is really nice. Had a lot of good luck with this one.
Joseph Kasprzak,"App is garbage. I feel like they made it super crappy on purpose hoping I'd actually spend money on it which is lame. You're no better than tinder, bumble."
Sean Gage,Way more detailed and thought out than Tinder
Junaid Siddiqui,Bumble is so much better than Tinder...
Kris Kahmann,Good alternative to Tinder
Saujanya Chaudhary,Better than tinder I think.. 🤟
Jasmyne Henry,basically tinder but better. and a little safer
Shwetang Keny,"I didn't got any Single match also in this app. On Tinder I got 5 and on OkCupid I got 7. Why I am not getting any match? I know girls should also swipe right to get a match. I thought Bumble would be much better than any other apps, so first downloaded Bumble. But I am getting better result on Tinder and OkCupid. Please try to improve your app (UI and Algorithms) to make it much cooler and attractive so that people will use this app."
GY,Better than Tinder!
Kristin Roark,"minus the ones who want to use this as a tinder, it's pretty cool. i like the bff feature."
M Lynne,"I have used Tinder, OkCupid and Bumble as my dating apps. Between the 3, Bumble has the most boring dudes that don't know how to hold a conversation, if they even respond at all (a majority do not). the few guys that I did meet because I thought they were interesting enough, turned out to also be very boring in person. I assume there is a correlation between men that want women to message them first, and introvertedness. hence why i recommend OkCupid instead, the men on there have backbones."
Divonne Tildon,I think this is way better then tinder but at the same time just wish we can text first but allow only verify people instead of fake accounts and wish they would stop ghosting after saying hi before time runs out. but anyways way better then tinder.
Denell Graves,by far Bumble is better than Tinder
Celestial Apollo,"DO NOT USE YOUR MONEY ON THIS APP! I paid for the 3 month boost and they took out the $49.99 but now the boost doesnt even work! I purchased it so long ago and it still just says ""try again later"". atleast with tinder when you bought their services they actually gave it to you! SCAM"
Cox,"crashes a lot, kind of difficult to swipe right compared to tinder and won't let me delete the question bio things. Only putting one star so they see this. I'll rate it four stars when I get a response."
Chee Kiat Teo,"a lot of inactive users, go for Tinder, save your time"
Kathleen Wong,"So I figured I would try Bumble since Tinder didn't work out. Fortunately the second guy I matched with was a pretty cool person. That experience was fine but note, it was within a week of me being on the app. So there was high exposure/a higher percentage of matching with someone. Fast forward some time later, no matches, or I match with someone I never swiped on, distances go beyond what I set it to, notifications lag, etc. it's a bittersweet app so far. Not sure I'll stay on it much longer."
Trygve Løvland,better than tinder
Joshua Dickerson,"Not bad.. Nothin much came if it yet, but still more respectable than Tinder.. Lol.."
twilight westwind,better than Tinder in every way possible
Yuri Perez,poor copy of tinder
Remo Gaggi,Females are much more engaging on this app than on tinder. Overall satisfied.
Kelsey Tobin,"I wish this app had the user base that tinder does in my area, it's a much better run service with way better customer support (for anyone who hasnt used tinder's customer ""support"", it's trash) and I like the multiple options for meeting different people"
Daniel Oosthuizen,Better than Tinder by far.
Erica Sylvatica,"i like bumble a lot better than Tinder, in terms of format and in terms of quality folks on the platform. I especially appreciate not accidentally ""super liking"" someone while trying to read their profile. I'll probably not go back"
Claudia Tranzow,so I think I like it better than tinder if I could just get past a 2-minute chat without someone mentioning sex I think I'd be okay but I do like this site and would like to find out how I can subscribe to a membership. I'm in culture shock from online dating I haven't dated in 20 years so it's a huge adjustment not sure if I liked it .. I'm a lady with class and I guess I prefer the old-fashioned way so who has time to go out after working ... I'm still hopeful I'll meet someone great
Greg Burman,"Decent dating app, and a much better concept than Tinder"
-,You do realize that it's common knowledge your app is full of fake profiles right? Like%60 of the women on here don't exist. And I'm not talking about the spam profiles you see on Tinder.  These are clearly put on there to make it look like Bumble is loaded with gorgeous women.
LaVonne Patoir,"compared to Tinder, it's much easier to be open about what you want/ what you are looking for. that makes things 10x easier. easy interface. ive tried using the BFF mode as well (abroad) to little success, but maybe others have had luck. never used to Business option."
christopher sherry,"this app in my opinion, has the best format of any dating app. The idea that the woman choose who they want to talk to is great. it keeps the woman interested in the app because they're not constantly receiving rude and creepy messages from disrespectful guys. about 75% of the women that ive talked to say that they feel safer and in control of their experience. also love that you aren't limited to a certain amount of swipes like tinder does."
santosh kanigicherla,"Need to improve on the App optimisation. Currently I feel its pretty heavy application and it takes lot of time to load the profile. Also, they need to work on the pricing. Its charging pretty high than its competitors, so if you want to increase your users, especially in India you need to do better than what you are doing currently. Tinder is way ahead on the pricing front."
Bailey Garrison,Better than tinder for shallow reasons. Wont load after the update. Guess ill just have to go outside and do something productive
Matthew Garman,Better than Tinder..
Albert Garrison,tinder for adults. lol.
Nick U,"This app falls in line with every other predatory dating app available today. They over push premium features, have terrible customer support, and allow for thousands of fake or inactive accounts to stay active. Do not download! Worse than Tinder. Update: Bumble support thinks Facebook or Twitter DM's are proper customer support. Get an actual phone number or email address and act like a real company with customers instead of some scam app piggybacking on other apps."
Phil Stern,great app. it works the right way. safer than tinder. bet.
M. A. Packer,"Used this app for a week after a friend recommended it, and stopped using it soon after. Not because it sucked, but because I met a nice girl and we're now in a serious relationship, considering marriage. Used Tinder and Mutual for years with no success beyond a few dates. Not saying Bumble is guaranteed, but it did help me find a great woman, and the fact they require women to make the first move actually seems to have helped considerably. Definitely recommend it."
Fen Krueger,I prefer Bumble to tinder or any of the other dating apps 😊 It feels more manageable and friendly
Eric L.,"Simple and functional, but not a great experience for the average guy. The concept of women messaging first is great, but this rarely stimulates engagement or more respectful conversations than with either gender initiating. At times, this app felt more superficial than Tinder. Superswipes, Spotlight and Boost are completely overpriced and generally a waste of money, especially compared to other apps' subscription services."
Kya Cooper The Soundtrack Of My Life Blog,"I have a much better experience with this app than with Tinder, POF, and most other dating apps"
Ryan Peterson,"It's Tinder with filters. A lot of dating apps have done a poor job differentiating themselves, Bumble included."
gaming place,this app sucks and just a waste. takes forever to get a match. can get more matches on tinder... TINDER ... that app is horrible but I get more matches on that.
Roy Kilgore,"Its a good app, and I really like the concept. The reason I gave 3 stars is because there seem to be alot of fake profiles, and they will make you pay to see any pending matches. However, it is, by far the best dating app out of Tinder, POF, and okc."
Scott Bae,"Good, clean looking app but there isn't really a way to further narrow down your search preferences so you may get alot of mismatches, if any. Hard to find people that actually want to meet up. Feels too much like tinder.  Unfortunately, app wasn't working for me so will try something else. Others may have better luck with it. ."
Drew Schroeder,"bumble has a day filter - mostly accurate. i set it to ""active"" girls and boom! super easy to use. the membership is too expensive for my taste though. i don't see much benefits. no stupid elo score algorithm like Tinder."
R. Serenity,"worst dating app I tried so far. if you're not a 10/10 man, the algorithm buries your profile so far down in the stack you're never shown to anybody and the only option you have is fork over your cash, ridiculous. other apps let you send messages or give you other options, here you're basically meat on display until you're chosen, not even tinder is this bad"
Tristan Banks,Better than Tinder but still pay to win. Also the fact that girls have to speak first means even if you match you are unlikely to keep it for 24 hours
Mr.Slendykins Sockman,"I met someone that I love and who loves me using this app, I can't thank enough for that. The monetisation side of things however is not as good as Tinder's, I feel like if the bumble membership came with the daily super likes and monthly boost like what Tinder Gold does then that would really get more people using the app, it's much better for finding genuine people as Tinder's mostly filled with people who want meetups."
Khaled Dean,"How brain dead must you be to create a dating app where women are the ones that a) make the first move...and b) have 24hrs to make that first move if you match? Stupidest concept ever! Complete waste of time, patience and effort. This is clearly a Tinder clone trying to pull off a gimmick in an attempt to make women feel more at control. Which is the reason why women ALWAYS approach men at clubs and bars. Try harder bumble....SO much harder!!!"
Pusztai Ferenc,It's way better than Tinder. Why can't download it in Hungary tho?
Joey Cal,"like tinder, but with fewer users"
Kai MacTrash,"Like every other app it allow you to identify as an gender but forces you back to male or female essentially by who will be shown your profile, asking if you wanna be associated as a man or woman. What's the point in giving people the choice of gender identity just to immediately ignore that. Be braver than tinder and actually move with the time."
SpotsUniverse,"Works like any dating app. Youll get the occasional match after maybe a whole day of swiping despite Bumble saying you have many who have swiped right on you. Without paying, your chances of matching are slim to none. Full of fake and inactive accounts. My Bumble profile is the same as my tinder which does well there. Stick to tinder for hookups or dating websites for something more. Average at best, sub par at worst. Give it a try though. Fun for a little bit and then you'll get bored."
Colin Reynolds,"Don't use a debit or credit with this app !!!!!!!! The app itself is ok not great , just another tinder style , but girls have to make the first move after you get a match. My big downfall for it is that I've cancelled my subscription and they are still charging me I emailed the people to ask for it to be stop and refunded but the only word I got back was the automatic response email that was four days ago now and im still being charged the daily fee."
Gabriel vB,"Best dating app so far. The fact, that the female has to write first, freshest things up and apparently because of that the woman here have more class than Tinder for instance."
raisethe voice,"The developer just following Tinder's rule about payment,that is not going to succesfull this app,why should we go for bumble?no reason. first female move is not a reason to be with bumble. they should make payment amt to keep in mind indian user."
Keith Smith,Not good at connecting with people close....always seems to match me with someone 30 miles away...like the format but needs some work...tinder seems to do better
Colie Catterson,"Great concept but not nearly enough space for a profile. Interesting to let the ladies make the first move, it might be better to give at least 48 hours to respond. I definitely still enjoy it over Tinder but there are better dating apps out there where you can learn a little more about someone & have time to contact them! Update: I met my boyfriend of 9 months on Bumble & we have an awesome relationship. I also now have a good friend off of BumbleBFF so it's certainly worth a shot!"
Byron,"I've tried them all and this app is sorta a fusion between Match and Tinder, but has the best of both worlds and seems to lack the trash found on Tinder. And the fact that women have to make the first move is genius. On other sites you have guys sending 100 thoughtful messages out to no or a few replies and women getting their inboxes flooded so don't even see half the messages they receive. So, Bumble is a win-win."
Tierra Sabir,this app is better than I expected. really thought it was just gonna be tinder 2.0
Ben Ward,"Not as good as tinder, don't waste your time"
Anthony Collier,"why have a feature the females have to message you first and they never message you first. just take it out, i had 8 matches and none them texted back. and the notification if you do get matches suck. just hortible experience. just use tinder."
Jeffrey Lucas,love this app i have had alot more luck on here then tinder alot of honest people...and met alot of nice girls on here
Britt P,"Honestly very pleased with the set up. It's like tinder for ""grown ups"" you can get more useful info about the person you matched with or are looking at."
Charleston Freeman,Way better than Tinder...
J P,overall better than tinder but only if you pay money. otherwise they send you a million other girls between matches that already liked you
Abhinav Kumar,More redined than tinder
John Velez,Better than tinder
Travis redmann,Sure the app is free but as a guy why would I want to pay for this app when the woman is only allowed to make the first contact? Doesnt make much good sense. I'll defiantly pay for tinder over this. Also a guy cant do a bathroom selfie but women can. If you are going to pay GO TO TINDER!!!!!! Also there are a ton of fake profiles on here. plus you keep seeing the same people month after month and normally those are the attractive ones so full on scam. Seriously men do not pay for this!!!
Carwyn Davies,Better than tinder
Ajay Meena,Better app than tinder. It gives more details about a person other than a picture before swiping right. bumbkebizz and bumblebff gives the app more versatality. I could have never imagined to find cofounder for startup through bumble. Great work.
Phu Phillip Trinh,better than Tinder 😂
Dylan Patterson,"Found two worth while dates on this app, as a relationship oriented person that's saying something for apps like this. You want flings, try tinder, you want a real relationship, bumble is ahead by miles"
AJ Erickson,crashes often. boost subscription charges you but doesn't show you likes. Tinder gets a bad rap but at least the App works🤷‍♀️
medusa blue,"I used this app in comparison to others like tinder, okcupid and hinge ( and other less useful ones ) and paid for VIP abilities on all (This for dating app research purposes) I have so far found bumble to be the very unreliable, as well as having no real advantage to Paying for service, I would not recommend compared to others"
Kevin Ngo,better then tinder
Sergio Visneskie,"Better algorithm than tinder. More serious business, less wasting time"
Tina Davis,Basically like tinder. But you get to decide if you want to be cat-called or not. I am not impressed. I thought it might be better. But it is not.
Travis Napier,"It's been pretty good, not better than Tinder in my area but that's probably since its not very popular yet."
shadeslayer114,"This app kind of seems like a cash grab. They want you to pay for almost everything. A ""bumble coin"" or whatever it is (super like on tinder) costs $1.99, where as Tinder at least gives you that for free. Also, the 24 hour period to message matches, and where women have to message first, seems a little pointless. Not everyone lives on their phones and people who didn't mean to right swipe can always unmatch as opposed to just waiting out the clock. You also have to pay to extend matches?"
lonetiger1000,becoming like tinder...might bow out soon
Shonky Sideways Sam,Much better than Tinder and the matches turn into actual dates.
John Beatty,The app keeps changing my profile picture from the one I select.. tells me I must have a clear pic when I can clearly see I am already providing a clear pic.. very frustrating! Tinder never gave me this issue.
Suneet Dsouza,"bumble my friend u are really useless in india( for dating ) ......it takes forever just to find one match and tht too texting ur match is next level forever ......... according to my own lil experiment 😂 i downloaded tinder and bumble on the same day and tinder was 💯 times better than bumble interms of rate finding matches , matches actually happening atleast once in forever ....but bumble is 👎 and the time i took for this experiment was roughly 1-2 months"
josh rogers,You get to meet more genuine people and less tinder trash cans
Y'shua Stokes,"good app, zero problems for me. less frustrating than tinder."
Gray Rook,the system works better then tinder or POF and most of the users are down to earth. still the app does have some toxic activist types.
Justin Meyerhofer,Seems like fewer fake accounts than Tinder or POF
Thomas Gadd,"Good for friends, dates, and just finding new people. Way better than tinder."
Tevin Henderson,App works well. Could use a better profile edititing layout. I feel this is a better version of Tinder. Its kind of a bummer that men cant message first because Ive had matches that never messaged me.So it would be nice to be able to message them at least if we matched. Otherwise this is better than tinder since it seems like less fakes are on here.
Kim Jarvis,"Matches expire after 24 hours, woman have to make the 1st move. Matches expire after only 24 hours, so if you speak to someone at 8pm one day, by 9pm the next day they are gone, unless you pay money. Plus woman have to make the 1st move. There is no way of turning this off. So all the initial work is done by me, rather than half and half like tinder. It's difficult thinking of lots of openers for people who have 1 sentence profiles!"
Naman Keshari,Amazing at least better than tinder
dez,At the moment it's better than tinder
Mary Shiley,"I really love this app, it is much much better than tinder, however, I receive likes from people nowhere near me. It would be awesome if I could customize my profile with distance from my current location, or set a location distance from home so I'm not receiving likes from when I travel."
Jim Johnny,Better than Tinder
ItsTheHomies,its better then tinder there is not as many spam and scam accounts I haven't had one .
eric Phillips,A lot better than Match or Tinder.
dolce dee,Better then tinder. Lol still. It's a dating app. Don't expect much.
desmond gibbs,way better than tinder
Christopher Jackson,it's like tinder except one person can send messages after you match.
Tom Williams,It's an interesting concept but there's just not enough people on there. I've had many more interesting conversations and more meetups on Tinder than here.
Leo Main,it's better than tinder 😂
Cells For Cheap,really good app. I'm more refined version of Tinder without the stigma of being used for hookups only.
Melissa Young,"It's ok, if you're looking for a hook-up. Maybe this is a the new Tinder and no one told me? In 1 week I was asked to hook up by 4 different men. Not helpful when trying to find someone special in a sea of horny turds. It's also pretty lame women have to make the first move. I get that someone has to, but by forcing me to, I resorted to ""hi"" for every single message."
Jay Q,"basically a female only version of tinder. same ads and spam that you'll find there, but only women can initiate convos. kind of a waste of time."
Will Frederiksen,The girls aren't as scary and don't ask me about the size of my genitals like on Tinder. I appreciate stricter community standards.
Joseph Bascetta,"Few matches. Even fewer messages. This app attracts women too timid to pursue a date, or they're also on tinder. They tell you you have matches you'll never see. Their system essentially preys off men by knowing they'll have few matches and showing ones they'll never find swiping in their match queue and drawing in women with a gimics like them messaging first somehow stopping creeps and their corporate paper thin feminist persona. Use Tinder."
Kayley Rolph,better than tinder
Laura,"Better than Tinder, but hate the vague time stamps on conversations (they get really confusing)"
Jermaine Christie,So in the latest update the bumble team have made it so that you can't get a match even when it show s that there is someone interested. The app now withholds the interested profiles from popping up until you upgrade to the paid version... What a scam. Back to pof and tinder Continues to scam users by withholding matches especially ones in a queue. I have over 10 matches in a queue but can never come across the during swiping... What a joke!
Amanda H,Better setup. it's hard to get into the tinder niche
A K,"Better than tinder but there's definitely some room for improvement!! Instead of only giving people 24 hours they should give people 72 hours to respond. ALSO, STOP SEXUALIZING AND CENSORING WOMEN'S BODIES. IF GUYS CAN POST SHIRTLESS PICS OR SWIM SUIT PICS OR PICS IN UNDERWEAR SO CAN WOMEN!!!! #endgenderdiscrimination ONE MORE THING: It would be great if this app was all inclusive with gender options! I identify as non-binary and there's only binary options to choose from #fail"
Brandon Bickham,"I just haven't had any luck on Bumble. It has been a few weeks already. My first few weeks on Tinder I had already had several dates and was having good conversation with several other ladies. Other than the bad luck, I like how the app is set up. Update 7/10/2019: I find it hard to believe that out of all the swiping I do, I have only matched with two users. something is wrong. I match and date with lots of people on other apps...many of which are on Bumble, but I have not matched."
Mohit Gogia,Better than Tinder.
Winged programme Hero626,Clicked on networking expecting to find people like me.. Losers instead i find over 100 different highly qualified professionals who i have basically nothing in common with and tbh i tried to persue them you never know but so far no takers lol i really didn't expect much.. I should of stayed on tinder with the rest if the idoits.
Max P,i like this app more than tinder tbh. women who use it aren't as flakey
PF Productions,"Much better than Tinder in terms of the matching process. The way the profiles are set up & presented give more emphasis to the written details. I got matches the first day I tried Bumble, although Day 2 was not as good. However, the Distance filter is too simplistic for someone living on one side of a major city needing to set a distance great enough to search the opposite side of suburbia, cos it brings up profiles from way OUTSIDE the catchment, which mostly won't be convenient, travel-wise."
Abhishek Shivmath,not good enough.. waste of time...tinder is better...
Ro Gmz,terrible app. basically pay to play. only slightly better than tinder
DeepC,"Amount of swipes on the free version is terrible compared to other dating apps, namely tinder. App runs smooth, but I never meet people off here because I refuse to pay for a mere handful of extra views"
D Redman,how is this different from tinder? either way the woman have a choice to respond and if I want to see the women who liked me i have to pay only for some still not to respond
Bradley Davis,"pretty good, wish app was as accessible as tinder tho"
Yadunandan Singh Rawat,Better then Tinder and other dating apps
Kelly Smith,"Really enjoying this app, finding it a lot better than tinder, more information off the guys, the fact girls can message first is cool. I'd only tweak a couple of things but overall really good app. :D"
Jon Smith,"Great if you're a girl, ok if you're a guy. Haven't met too many people from the app, girls have to do a little more leg work on this than tinder. overall not a bad app, a little to many in app purchases for my liking."
Gurjan Oberoi,"They are unnecessarily charging 749/ month. In India, after swiping 20- 30 people, it says 'All caught up.' They should have reduced the prices to attract more people. I would recommend to go for Tinder instead. Don't waste money here unless you are looking for something sophisticated."
Jose Alfaro,Just use Tinder. This app is a joke.
MacKinnley Colgan,"I like the app and the combo between tinder and profile based dating. I do enjoy not getting spammed by people who are not a match, but am frustrated that I can be the only one to send the first message... and then pray they happen to check in time to send me one back before we are again unable to message. I wish that either we could both message first, or that guys had maybe 48 hours to respond?"
Gurdain Singh Madan,"I like it more than Tinder because the ratio of men to women is better i.e. More women, less men. It's convenient to use for men since women make the first move. It's convenient for women since they decide who to message first and don't receive unnecessary messages from men."
Claudia Tranzow,Fun app much Better than Tinder..
Wes Garcia,more matches on tinder. this app is all jesus freaks who dont realize that on Bumble they have to message first.
Eric Synoptics,Great app. Better than Tinder.
Marcelo D,Cool concept even that it doesn't always work but that's not the apps fault and at least it isn't a scam like Tinder after the first month.
Gavin baker,better than tinder
Tyler Johnson,Started off getting a decent amount of matches at 3-5 a day. As time went on it tapered off. I swiped 5-10 min a day and got 1 match in the past 2 months. Meanwhile my tinder and OkCupid are blowing up. This app is trash.
Wyatt Knoble,better then tinder in my opinion!!
Rabbabunny Music,it's much better than Tinder. the people are much more friendly. I love how the 24th our thingy works but sometimes I loose pretty awesome matches hehe
Elizabeth Ray,"pretty good, like tinder but more pressure. I've heard that people who are more serious about dating on on here, and I get it but it's a lot of pressure to reply right away. Don't like the fact that if you have a busy life you might miss an opportunity to connect with someone."
Navid Golforoushan,like the app. better than tinder or match. recommend 😉
Justin Tam,"Ease of use is ok, but still not as good as Tinder. OKC, etc. Everytime I use this it never works for me. I won't use it again."
Chase Alvarado,"better than tinder, but apps with premium are always dumb. It doesnt give everyone the same chance and that sucks if you cant afford it. not saying im broke but i feel like i shouldnt have to put money towards something like this in order to for sure find a match"
Brenton Bolderoff,"worst then tinder, tinder is awful but anything else is worse, my observation"
Elizabeth Podboy,so much better then tinder if your looking for more than a one nighter
David Moore,More than a hookup ap like Tinder. Better even than some of the paid sites. You have more ability to chat see your messages etc and its free. I really like it.
kaushal bathia,"Verified accounts, many checks to see if you're compatible with another user, much better than tinder!"
Ethan Kleinrichert,"Utter garbage -- Charges undisclosed amounts for paid features, requires too many mandatory updates, plus the support is trash. 2.5/10, just go to tinder."
Gold TrojanMan,"i like that it takes the ""free validation"" factor out of the app. The woman has to message you first so unless you message back she can never truly know if youre interested which is good cause apps like tinder or pof women exploit the fact that they have to put in no effort. Plus those apps dont want you to find a spouse they just want you to date thousands of people and spend money taking temporary people out to places that you know deep down youll never see again."
Everett Allen,This service is higher quality and class than Tinder. And it seems to have a closer balance of men and women.
Shane Albuquerque,"Quite no of people, but no matches, its quite a dead dating app like Tinder"
Ajit Mann,"Absolutely useless. person u match with don't respond, no new profiles shown daily. its fake app.dont waste time on it. tinder is far better."
JAMESJAMESJAMES Castañeda,"free use but as a male i think this is better than tinder premium = Thank you Bumble! I don't mind ads or not being able to be the first one to make contact, makes life easier actually//prevents wasting time lol..."
David Hency,It's a lot better than Tinder!
Curtis,"Kind of like the idea of girls messaging first cause tinder is the polar opposite. Only bad thing is when the match expires and she's absolute solid 10, rip."
Choked Rat,Just get Tinder.
Prince Of Darkness,way better than tinder
Matthew Brandes,similar to tinder. owner was from tinder. for guys this is better than tinder.
vaibhav oswal,Ek number app. So much better than tinder. Has quality people.
Krysta Townsend,better than tinder
L Toledo,"You'll get the picture of you at the range with a gun (even though it's your job) but the girls with every picture having a snapchat filter stay on their profiles. You also have to filter through the ""I only message people who daily extend me"" or ""I messaged first so you must message me twice, because you're the guy"" I've only met a few girls that developed to more than just a date. I'll just go back to Tinder."
Brian Keller,"The best dating app -- and I've tried Tinder, Hinge, and OKC. The folks seem less skeezy, the format seems to work, and the app itself is solid."
Big Robbie,it's pretty good little more classy than tinder not quite as classy as hinge but worth taking a look at what's around
Jiro Katsutoshi,Great UI and awesome description features compared to Tinder. Just wish I swiped right more haha
Ben Smith,Bumble is way better than Tinder!
Eu-Juan Meintjes,"Bunch of liberal feminists/sjws who think too much of themselves. I'd rather take shallow tinder people than pretentious, virtue signalling leftists. Not male friendly at all."
Mathias F,"has some fake accounts but on the whole, plenty of lovely educated women to meet. more tasteful than tinder. cannot speak for the quality of men. only gives 24hrs for a reply when matched. far too short a time. women must intiate converstion. buying coins to say hello not worth the charge."
Fred Lagrasse,great app so much better and cleaner than tinder like wow no robots too its night and day comparison!😎
Video Gameist,Better Than Tinder
Tom Glover,Really like this app it's a better version of tinder
Eric Robertson,I was excited but havent had any matches better off with Tinder you'll have more matches at least
Robby Nines,"pretty straightforward app. for the most part what you see is what you get here. . not too many catfish accounts from what I've seen unlike tinder where it's all phoney accts, cam girls and trannys. I reccomend it to all my friends."
Ben Landry,much better than tinder or okcupid
MiddleClass Gear,Better than Tinder
Travis Webb,"SCAM. DO NOT BUY. Fake Tinder. No Refunds. I tried this out and a few minutes into using it it said I had people who liked my profile. I misread, the price confusing pricr options. I got one ans was suprised it was $86. I decided to go see who the likse wre from. IT WAS BLANK. IT WAS A SCAM. Within 2 minutes I went to the app page to see the removed rhe refund button then emailed them, and they replied No refunds, though its within 48 hours. 5 hours later I am pissed."
Chris Shelby,"3 stars for the app concept only. I like the idea of this app but I find that most women still dont want to message first (even when I extend a match) and they let matches expire more often than not. If one does message, I try to engage in conversation but its a few short messages then they ghost. Super swipes are worthless. I though I'd find more mature women here than Tinder but I've had a way better experience there than here. Hopefully other guys have had better luck than I have."
abhijit badgujar,good app. Genuine matches and smooth functioning. way better than tinder.
Unique Abujarad,"I think that this is just an off brand knock off of Tinder, there are no real connections or true meaning to it, it sucks and I feel bad for the guys who are paying for any service. The time wasted even downloading this horrible app you can meet someone at Starbucks and offer to buy their latte' and 2 double shots of expresso. I have had it and that is why i am creating a new app. A real dating app without all the nonsense, no more fly by nights and fake profiles. Yes men use other guys images too. The app sucks you cant even post pictures of your legs!!!  Whoever created this app must have pencil stick legs with no tan!"
Benjamin Brauer,so much better than tinder
Christina Salter,I thoroughly have enjoyed my use of Bumble have only encountered 2 creepy people on the Site/App unlike Tinder for example I get 6+ creeps in my inbox or adding my Snapchat but come to recent event I am uninstalling Bumble I've had an amazing experience or I wouldn't have wrote a long review thank you everyone who works for the bumble the great experience! :))
Mr. Green,"Better than Tinder I'd say. If you're looking for a better chance at something real, and want to engaelge in a place where intentions are a bit more upfront, this is the place. I've had more success on this app than Tinder. I find that people are a lot more honest here. Only think i would say, is that notifications have to be improved. The app only push notifications if the app is open in the background. This could be why some people miss matches."
Delain Turner,meh tinder has better opportunity. but take your shot
Joshua Diogo,you know it's really frustrating that you wont allow people to put what they want as the main pic because your app decides it doesnt like it. tinder doesn't have that issue.
Chance Deyesso,way better than tinder
Louis Marc,Better interface than Tinder and doesn't spam notifications like Happn.
Janvi Singh,totally useless app tinder is far better than this
ben halevy,"not that good, but more effective than tinder app"
Kevin Morris,"I've learned that EVERY female (Which is what Bumble promotes to me) from Romulus, Michigan is a fake profile. Bumble is become the new Tinder with all their fake women profiles"
Austin Nagy,never failed me... tinder sucks
Max Max,nice app better than tinder in the uk
Ash Taylor,Getting plenty of matches on Tinder with the same profile yet nothing on here. Clearly they're trying to drive sales. Pay to win. A shame really.
Henry Loader,much prefer this to tinder grinder etc
Zachary Zoellner,I for real get more matches here than I do on tinder. Also its nice to have a girl to break the ice first since us guys dont really get to experience that very often. I recommend this app!
Levi Strauss,way better than tinder
Vinayak Patankar,great app better than tinder or any other dating app in India... completely authentic dating profiles and matchmaking system even for free users
J N,"Compared to Tinder, Hinge, and OkCupid, this is the inferior dating app. I think there is potential in the format (women message first), however the algorithm that determines who you appear to is poorly designed. I know my profile doesn't suck, I get tons of matches (and dates) using other apps. I've had this for two weeks and only recieved one match. Maybe this is a gimmick to get you to pay for premium features, who knows. Whatever the case, there are vastly better options available."
Justin Lemke,"Easy to use, seems more classy than Tinder"
The Boy Wonder,Hundred times better than Tinder
Lorenzo,"bad app, won't let me upload pics yet so many fake profiles of girls profiles. This app is a crappier version of tinder. don't waste your time!!"
Gayan Pathirana,better than tinder 😊
Pat Doyle,Better than tinder
Vijay Prakash,You're same like Tinder & others apps money minded.. First try to provide access with people.. For everything we have to buy..
Nameless Data,"APP IS DEAD. Waste of time. Very low public engagement because nobody uses the app. All you get is daily notifications to open the app only to see nothing because its a ghost town. There is a feature to see who ""liked"" you but it's locked behind a paywall that keeps being pushed on you. These are ""likes"" from people outside your desireable range and most of them you already swiped left on, so no point paying for something you're not interested in. Somehow they managed to be worse than Tinder"
Shea Elsey,"I really liked it at first but like Tinder they don't give you the best filter options and they run out of possible matches after like 15 swipes. When most of those swipes are left, it sucks. Maybe there just aren't many people signing up for their app? I mean I'm smack in the middle of 2 large cities Austin and Waco. And the world largest Army base. You'd think there would be a lot more people joining in my area."
Dustin Hambrick,"It's like Tinder, but better. As a man it's refreshing to have the women make the first move."
Bee Bee,better than POF and Tinder
Hank Ceballos,I have Tinder and a couple of other apps. Bumble had better looking girls and better quality girls
Michael Robbins,It has cuter girls than Tinder but works mostly the same.
Sas Vassie,"Well it does what it saying on the tin. You post your pics, you swipe and get likes, you say something random before the sodding app starts poking you and 50% of guys reply back. No different from Tinder except the number of pathetic f*ckboys seems to be about half. Bumble! Sort out your sodding notifications. If I have every notification turned OFF except messages received I do not expect to receive your absolute drivel nagging me to message people, telling me who's online etc. Ffs!"
Kurt Taylor,pretty good better than tinder
James Lee,amazing I found my dream girl on here and it's amazing 🔒💕 took only a few hours until I met her and it's free talking to each other unlike tinder this app is the best .
Rafael Melendez,"The app is pretty nice and simple. and its not filled with bots like tinder. I recommend to does who want a preferred app,also has some bugs when checking youre subscription"
Derek Glasscock,"have the paid version. im a good looking 27 year old. i havent even gotten a swipe in over a month. if its like this for me, i dont even wanna know an average guys experience with an unpaid account. who knows maybe they dont prioritize paid accounts. features with the paid account are also mostly useless. maybe a spotlight now and then would allow my $20/month account to get a like now and then. instead i dont use this trash. literally tinder is better, and thats sad."
A Google user,"Some cute young ladies. Better than tinder and other dating apps im sure, least for those whose intentions are more than jus hook ups. wish the best for people(me included)."
Chinmay Mi,"Giving only girls the opportunity to text back first after match, is pathetic. There should be one free superlike available like Tinder. Otherwise a good app"
X X,"Great app, better than Tinder but the messaging system could be drastically improved."
DM F,"I joined tinder and matched with the same profiles that I couldn't match with on Bumble? Wth? This app always crashes, a match had to send me a screenshot proving she's verified as she was not verified on my side? Sometimes when I try to log in it says no connection, freezes and I've noticed sometimes I have to swipe then I notice I get new messages? Luckily I only paid a weekly subscription, cancelling this and deleting. Funny I joined tinder 2 days ago and have over 150 matches? Only 8 on Bumbl"
o jee,"Few matches, even less actual conversations, zero meet-ups. This app is just excruciatingly depressing for males. Just like Tinder, no difference, even though advertised."
Bomah,it's tinder with the feature of girls texting first
Julián Jaramillo,Nice. Better than Tinder.
Sean Required field cannot be left blank,"Great app, great premise, however, sometimes the app has a hard time finding my location. Also, there are less folks on it than Tinder."
Michael Klurfeld,It's like tinder but the folks are more likely to say something of substance.
James Wilson,"You add some stupid gender identity bs for 40 different genders now it shows men and bi sexual woman in my feed who are just looking for girls for a threesome. stupid app. and price is rediculous, be more like tinder and go simple. I shouldn't have the option to message first when the whole thing is meant to be based on women talking first.."
Krishna SIngh Rathore,not a single match but got 90+ matches on tinder
Marcus Kapoor,"It needs an optional filter for empty bios. The app prides itself in being more bio focused than tinder, but girls still treat it the same so there's practically no difference."
Cindy LouWho,"bumble global connector bee is a scam just to get more users to use their app than tinder...kinda desperate don't you think? Next time, tell the truth and don't just hand pick your users without giving everyone a far chance in general. Many people have reported the same problem with that advertisement, that if your adjust your settings to the max and swipe a bunch until you find the bumble global connector app, but instead you just run into spotlight advertisements, do NOT pay for this app."
Andrew Richardson,Better than Tinder
rishi shrimali,cheater app...Not any match..since long time...nobody uses.....Compare to it Tinder is much much better...
Cullan Daly,It works worse than tinder but it's cleverly designed and good for people who are already attractive.
Goku Son,basically a worse tinder if women don't message you you're basically screwed
Rain,"This is a pretty good dating app honestly. The people I've met thus far have all been really genuine and lowkey I've found more mature guys who are actually looking for a relationship on here, whereas Tinder you'll find more people just trying to bang."
Clay Cook,"Completely sexist profile picture policy. Tons of girls with bikini profile pics, yet it wont let me have a profile picture of me in a swimming suit. If I can't show off my hard work on my body then this app is not for me. Tinder still reigns supreme."
Mateusz Sirant,got more luck with this than cupid or tinder
Snoopy Macc,better than Tinder
Jorge Padilla,"I really like this concept of women messeging first... For once. But like tinder, not getting that many matches."
Sam Kulifay,"best dating app out there, way better than tinder, match or anything else"
Darrell S,"Its tinder with a yellow icon. Little doubt they use an algorithm that makes your profile near the top of a que. Then after a week or so you are at the bottom. I received 12 matches (1/2 of which never spoke) in 48 hours, didn't pay, and haven't had a match since. There is nothing illegal about dating sites buying dating profile databases. Google it! If you enjoy look ing at women who have a lot of cleavage hanging out then this is definitely the place you want to be. I am happy to browse."
O,Bought coins and none went into my account. Auto set my range to less than a mile so I couldn't see anybody and I couldn't change it. Plus it caters to women just like tinder. COMPLETE RIP OFF
Chris Snook,In a tie for the worst dating app available. Just another carbon copy of tinder. Next time try to have an original idea.
Rahjah La Monstah,"Better than tinder for me because I see women who are looking for women not all the damn women on tinder or men who are looking for women and not all the men including men who aren't interested in what I have to offer😏tinder step yo game up. but other that, it's literally the same app 😂😂😂😂"
Dominic Reid,"I think the app is a good idea but fails in practice as a result of a poor user base. Most of the matches I got never even bothered to message and a lot of them place their instagram handle in their description, as a tactic to get more followers/dms. My match count was far lower than tinder and overall this app just lowers self confidence and is frustrating from a male user standpoint. I'm sure it's been great for other people, but personally not a fan."
Ryan O'Connor,"The most ridiculous thing about ""feminist Tinder"" is that has a photo sharing feature..."
Gunar,"I like the idea of the women messaging then men first but I also would love to have an option to potentially be able to message the lady first with a ""super like"" or something along the lines. In my opinion it's a mediocre app that is basically like tinder."
TJ Connell,had an issue with my account/payments and reached out on Twitter. Bumble responded promptly amd resolved the issue within 2 days. They were polite and actually refunded an amount. what a pleasant suprise to find a social giant actually care and try to help you. these folks are everything Tinder is NOT. All my stars if I could.
Sridhar Venkatesh,It's got a much better interface and system than Tinder.
Chanchal Suresh,"Best dating app I ever used. Far better than tinder, woo and other competetors. Must download. This app wont loot money from you. Just enjoy Bumble."
Salim You,It seems to me that if you dont pay your profile wont show up to others. massive waste of time and storage on phone. seems that by reading other reviews tinder is still the best app.
Shawnna Gardner,"once you match with someone, only the female can send the first message. don't understand why this is even a thing. tried it for a week and deleting it. at least on tinder and POF, both genders can send a message"
Adam Sweeney,"absolute pain to try and use. currently have 5 photos on my profile which IS CLEARLY ME but yet my profile is locked down ""until i upload a photo of myself"" had the exact same problem months ago and i stopped using it, updated today and same rubbish again. stick to tinder its leaps and bounds ahead of this muck."
Jose Ortega,hmm..I dunno how I feel about this app..it has similarities with tinder but the difference and I am not sure if it's a good idea that when you get matches you have to wait for the female to contact you because I have gotten tons of matches but the women go on a 24 hour timer to respond you and if they don't they disappear from your list...and for what I have experienced the females are quick to say they like you but won't respond so it leads me to think that this app is populated with bots 🙄
Sauman Bhakta,It does work unlike tinder!!3
Leo Dantès,"Better than tinder, because it puts more focus on the woman to make first contact so better matches, but still a swipe app so low quality matches are more likely."
KARAN PUSHP,"It for sure is better than tinder, i actually am impressed by the crowd here ."
Colton Carey,Better than Tinder imo
simon nixon,I committed to 1 day of service just to try it and was charged for three months. contacted Bumble and they said sorry tough luck kid even though it was less then 24 hrs after I signed up.This is some scum baggery going on here. save your money and get Tinder or something.
Dannii Draven,"recommend this app over tinder! WARNING it is addicting, but use it as a tool to meet people, and when you get off your phone your starting to create a life"
Nalamati Chaitanya,I purchased this app but no use simply waste of money no customer care support and Ntng better investing in tinder would be a great idea
Jeeon,"had plenty of dates on here and tinder as well. met some cool people. however sometimes it seems I'll consistently get matches and others times nothing for weeks . . . same profile, pics, etc."
Ronald Thomas,"Best dating app in my opinion, I deleted the others such as tinder, match, okcupid, plenty of fish...etc. most efficient use of time dating app!"
William Murray,"This app sucks. They want women to message you first but when you match with one, she won't message you at all. So just like Tinder, this app is full of bots. Terrible app. Abhorrent design. Laughable quality. Don't waste your time with this malarkey"
Amanda Ripley,I like this app more than tinder.. BUT it would've been nice to have guys text first also....
VICEGRIPS N MONKEYWRENCHES,a little better than tinder. you can actually see people interests on this app. the girls also seem better quality and not as preppy. still garbage. better chances of getting a date by actually approaching women.
Joshua Walker,"'premium' is RIDICULOUSLY expensive for how few features it gives you, they aren't upfront about said features either. It's just bootleg tinder, and the friend finder mode is just grindr in disguise. The app will not send you notifications no matter what, and will randomly break requiring you to restart it. Your matches will use it as much as you do, so have fun with 1 message a day. And because your new matches have 24 h to message you, and notifications don't work, you'll lose a lot of them."
Brodrick Lyles,Better than Tinder
Kai Gillespie,"Matches are super rare, conversations even more so. HUGE waste of time for any guy. PoF has better results, even after ignoring all the bots. Best option, stick to Tinder."
Mas Queey,"I really like this dating app! It allows you to set your preferences admit which people you'd want to date and show others what you're looking for. Also by enforcing a conversation to start within 24 hours, it makes sure you get matches that actually want to talk with you. It also has a much friendlier and personal feel than Tinder. The only downside is that there just aren't as many people on here as there are on Tinder, it only takes you about a day to get through everyone in your region."
Emmanuel Ortiz-Rodriguez,I have to be honest with this app this is one the best apps that I have ever used for a dating site they actually have real women that message you and I do not have to pay for the messages which is pretty cool I've only been using this literally 8 hours and I am getting a hit already. Bit I highly recommend this application app for anyone and everyone it is way better than tinder plenty of fish.
Max Kemper,"So after pretty sub-par experiences with Tinder, I had high hopes for Bumble, mainly due to their selling point of the girls making the first move. However, to my disappointment it turned out to be just another Tinder. After swiping on one to three people, it will tell you that you need to wait for more to show up, which typically takes until the next day. And the people who have liked your profile can of course only be viewed if you get a subscription. Yet another cash grab, what a shame."
Derek Patterson,definitely get better results than tinder. placed the same profile on both and got a lot more matches and messages on Bumble
Franz,"this app used to be cool. now it's just another Tinder copycat with premium restrictions. did Bumble get bought or something? what's next, 50 swipes limit per day? u guys really dropped the ball here."
Rishav Datta,"it's like the best version tinder could produce, met a lot of like minded people helped me a lot"
Nancy Pong,pretty good. if you're looking for a step up from tinder this is it
Aaron Harrington,"So far it seems better than Tinder. The algorithm seems so much more fluid, then again I've only recently joined and that's how it usually goes upon first creating accounts on such apps. Seems like a better app though in terms of smoothness and detail."
Jack Holguin,Good for meeting beautiful women and better that Tinder
Anant Singh,It's better than tinder for me
Mr. Cloud,"Had a couple of matches in the first few hours but then they magically dried up, as if the app was trying to tell me that I should upgrade my account to keep getting them. I get the feeling that you're never visible on anyone's swipe list on this app, just like tinder. And I don't like the sausage being dangled in front of my nose with the prospect of matches and such, thus I am uninstalling."
Mike Lee,great way to meet hot single girls.....better than tinder better than pof
Gabe Schoenfeld,less fake accounts that tinder
Ciaran Burke,"Better than tinder. The ""ladies first"" set up is a good one, except a lot of people abuse it where they'll just send a message if they match so the match doesn't expire. Then they just ignore them. At least that's what I presume must be happening unless they just have ludicrously short attention spans."
Ryan Balmer,whatever algorithm they use for matching needs alot of work. or the apps dead. pity use to be my favorite over tinder.
Will Tobin,"Holding back people who have liked you as ransom to buy a premium version is DISGUSTING. I understand it's a business and Bumble's goal is to make money. However though, I've had 12 women who have liked my profile and have been kept hidden unless I pay the app for nearly a year. It's only hurting the app. If you could know right away who likes you and people could know right away you like them, this app would blow tinder out of the water if that was the case."
Jeremy Hopkins,good app much better than tinder. alot less fakes.
Ashley Richardson,I enjoy it. you can do way more stuff on here than on tinder and badoo.
Jenny Klingler,this app is head-and-shoulders over Tinder as far as finding people that are serious about a relationship
Paul Winther,Waste of time Update: redownloaded again about 2-3 years after I first tried and reviewed bumble. It still sucks. idk why but tinder and hinge are much better for me. Deleting this again
Charlie De Los Santos,i singed up for a free trial of their subscriptions and got no notification or was it in my subscription section on tue playstore and have been being charged $2.99 for weeks and hagevdeleted the app a while ago.The cancel subscription option in such small text its barley noticeable which is very scummy of them because i had to look clsoely just to see it. I wont even try to contact customer care because I highly doubt ill get a refund. Stick to Tinder or another dating app this app is a scam.
Katie Rice,Bumble is overall a great app! definitely prefer it to Tinder. I love that you can say you are looking for a relationship so you can immediately weed out the people who aren't looking for anything serious.
Marcos Castellanos,I have more luck on Tinder there's more people on there bumble bee websites kind of boring I swipe through for 5 people then I won't get nothing or another 3 days 2
Surjit Chohan,They dont allow you enough time to meet someone and niay professionals need more time to connect rather than 24 to 48 hours. They charge a mot but dont deliver ots a Nusiness Model the less time you give people to connect the more money they make. Boooo.Back to Tinder or OKC.
Dane Miller,So far the app is far better at matching then tinder where I've had ten plus likes and can't seem to find any of those people. I won't lie it's super nice as a guy to not have to make the first move.
Nikolai,A good dating app. Worth using. Higher quality than Tinder.
vaibhav singh,better tha tinder
Brad Mattin,better than match or tinder
Phillip Gratton,tinder sucks compared to this
In The Ghett0,Like tinder but with a lot more substance.
Mark,loads better than tinder... and cheaper. still few fake profiles but overall not a bad experience.
Ashley oko,"it's pretty good it's a swipe left to right kinda thing.you have to pay to see who likes you which is fare. you can set filters how tall or short you want someone to be. free to chat. I've tried tinder, hily, plenty O fish, farmers only, and OkCupid. I like Bumble the best so far."
Jordan Barile,tinder is still better
Lisa B,"So I told my friends after 4 weeks with talking to this guy I met on this app I would review it and what do you know.... honestly its treated a lot different than tinder, and it's less hookups and more personal. it took me a while to find someone and honestly we're still amazed at all our similarities."
Scott Broadbent,"It's pretty sad when you get more matches on Tinder... literally, after months of being on here I had all of one match and they couldn't be bothered to say hello. Constantly getting notifications to try to draw me back. If you're not one of the 20% of men who get most of the attention, you probably will be disappointed with this."
Ichiroo,limited swipe even the swipe left still counted i wondered why!? we stan Tinder ftw!
Garry B,An app that reduces dating to a complete meat market. It's just deciding if you like someone solely from a single image. Tinder is less inherently superficial than this.
Luke Mulfinger,better than tinder
ruby odendaal,kept getting notifications about how popular i was and that i had 50+ likes but only 3 matches 😂 used it just as much as tinder and hinge and had over 30 matches on those. also had two pics deleted because they werent modest enough... was wearing a long sleeve shirt and pants in one of the pictures and its an outfit i wear to work. pictures in question were my only ones without a high neck line so felt a bit like it was due to my chest size since i saw plenty of shirtless pics of guys...
T Cole,its a good app not hella adds like most and its not cluddered like badoo or pof definitely equal to tinder
Lisa Walz,"The matches aren't exactly matches. Only in distance, and it still tends to be a hook up dating app like tinder. Except its ladies choice. Thank you for donating on my behalf, but, it would be nice to be able to scroll down for the choices... the app has been stuck on the donation page for 2 days..."
Ben Dalgleish,like tinder but with added tories
Rebecca Purcell,great for narrowing down based on criteria. much better than tinder
Benji Benji,wish they gave u more matches per a day lile tinder
erin matthews,better than Tinder
Philip Bogachuk,Just a waste of time. My advice to people is to try Tinder or Hinge. Much better chances of meeting someone. Bumble sucks!
Mario Miranda,better than Tinder
Jonathan Harrington,Better than the Tinder scam app. Innovative concept (ladies first) separates it from the pack. Generally pretty Progressive -- they banned gun nuts from showing pics of their surrogate wieners. Women may still experience unwanted photos; men may experience blackmail attempts by scammers (happened only once in my use of the app).
Aubrey Kapree,"Pretty sure Bumble doesn't work. I swiped right to several dozen over the past couple days and have gotten only 2 matches. So, I try Tinder and I got 2 matches in 5 minutes. You guys at Bumble should look into this. Many people seem to be complaining about not getting matches, so clearly this isnt a coincidence."
Ahmed Morsi,"the algorithm for this app is not like tinder, the more you like the lower you go in rankings. it is.highly bias, my personal opinion, tinder is still the superior app..bumble has a long way to go and it needs to be less prejudicial.towards users who swipe a lot , the focus and success should be reflected in the number of successful relationships, these guys are all about the green."
Aether Ferrum,"Thousands of times better than Tinder, with more options to express yourself and the option to simply find friends! I like the app a lot :)"
Andrew Hallen,its way better than tinder
Jordan Matheson,better than tinder
Achu k,"I live in Dubai, Recently first time started using Bumble. I really like this app Bumble, good profiles, got a positive reply from a profile. but its very very sad that, cannot use Bumble without VPN in Dubai, even Tinder is available in Dubai without VPN. I would rate 5, if this app can connect without VPN. it's very difficult to connect via VPN. Please resolve this issue"
Prim Baxter,This app is so much better than Tinder if your not looking for a hook up.
Erin,"I apparently have a bunch of matches, but can only see two. Makes it really hard to make the first move within the 24 hour window I'm given. From what the other reviews say, this is a blatant money grab. Back to Tinder I go."
Bryce Carson,The app is actuslly coded well. Tinder & OkCupid run like garbage.
Crimson Marauder,Bumble is practically Tinder on hard mode. Also when it notifies me that i got a like nothing shows up on my queue. This has happened multiple times. It should be noted that I am paying for the service as well.
Maciej Cierkosz,"Bumble as a dating platform is pretty good and innovative. Better rules than on Tinder. Also it's creators are not as greedy - using it without premium features does not impair or impact the experience. I think in this regard that's the best dating service on the market here, in Ireland. So why three stars You ask? Unfortunately as an app Bumble needs fixes. The most irritating thing - notifications. Even though I saw all the messages from some people app continues to notify me! Please fix that!"
Travis Stone,haha I went from getting nothing on Tinder to getting lots of messages on bumble.
Karthik Gathu,A good app with an amazing logic of matching. unlike Tinder the user profiles look much detailed.
Meunomenaoethiago,pretty nice so far. the profiles here dont make me wanna throw up in my mouth like the copy paste ones on tinder... so i'd say its a win
Ricky Ricardo,"It's a good dating app (certainly much better than Tinder) and I like the features like being able to backtrack and having profiles based on questions. The idea of having to chat within 24 hours is nice in theory, but it doesn't really seem to fix there being a ton of matches who just never respond. My biggest complaint is that once you're out of matches you rarely get any more and the ones you do get are people who haven't swiped on you."
Ayush Mishra,Better than Tinder.
Patrick Nichols,Love the set up! Much easier and approachable for guys than tinder!!
Scholtz Buys,"this app is awesome, much better than tinder infinos the ladies here are very professional and conversation wise much more effective."
Jack Scarborough,Honestly the app is pretty good on the whole and is of significantly better than tinder. The people on are fortunately looking for a relationship and if not clearly advertise the fact. My biggest issue is the app clearly gives preferential treatment to profile which are more often swiped. This therefore buries many of the accounts of those are of normal attractiveness which seems abusive and unfair.
four twenty,good app. im heavy user but it works nice. and ive connected with more people in person then tinder.
Pierre Cassis,"Free to swipe and when you match still free to message! You have a choice of 2 free filters to apply so can search criterias specifically! Easy to use too, bye bye tinder!!"
Steven Rogers,"I know it's a coincidence that I met my future wife on Bumble, but it's still cool. I had previously tried Match, eHarmony, OkCupid, Tinder, and a few others. I had one serious relationship via Tinder. I thought I'd end up with her, but she broke up with me. I deleted Tinder and then had fun dates via OkCupid. It was fine, but then I found Bumble. Didn't pay anything (unlike Match and Tinder). We got engaged March 23, 2019! I'd rank them: Bumble, OkC, Tinder... and everything else tied for last."
Grace Cassel,way better than tinder if you're looking to make real connections 👍
Kelly Nuñez Tozzi,very similar to Tinder
Komal Bayati,Horrible app. Gives you 10 swipes a day unless you pay their ridiculous prices. I've been with 230 girls but I can't get a match on Bumble to save my life. That's because everyone on Bumble is white and are looking for white guys. They need to promote diversity on this app or something. Tinder is more inclusive and I've probably met 10-15 girls on there.
Ashley Wragg,Good overall experience. The users seem to have a higher standard than your Typical Tinder users.
Roller Simmer,I love Bumble. Better than Tinder.
Salt,"i downloaded it today after tinder didn't work out, and surprise surprise, it doesn't allow me to log in using my phone number. it only says ""please check the phone number you entered"" despite it being 100% correct. unsure of how I'm supposed to use this app if I can't even use a phone number."
Triplej3__,Better than tinder.
Max Reinwardt,"tinder clone, yet all the gimmicky features that make it different make it worst - i can finally relate to the female experience on dating apps, having a bunch of heys in my inbox"
Andrew Snyder,"I've had the fortune of using the app in both a medium (60,000) and large (+800,000) city. In a large city there's regularly new users. Women having to send the first message is nice for guys (less pressure), and lets girls decide if they're actually interested as guys can NOT (even if they want) send the 1st message. Better than tinder, but need to focus on increasing marketing to get more users. Great job!!"
K Jay,definitely a more mature vibe than Tinder.
Natasha Arksey,Better pool of fish than Tinder.
Michael Farfel,"overall solid but i dont like how it tries to make you upgrade,kinda shady but tinder does the same thing"
Lucinda Pavitt,"Really good dating app. Much prefer it to hinge or tinder. Has more details about the person, girls have to message first. The only down side is losing a match if they don't respond fast enough, but I guess that filters out the people that aren't bothered!"
Vasudha Verma,"100% better than tinder, great features. the filters are great. love it."
Gary Lucich,"The app has a decent interface at surface level. However, a series of small issues (badge notifications appearing without corresponding in-app activity, non-existent match rates in current version and location versus previous) emerged. I messaged Bumble three separate times to hopefully address the issues, and I never received a response. Turns out that the email address that they use for non-apple product feedback doesn't work- all three emails were returned. Now I have to resort to Tinder."
JonathanB117,"It's better (imo) than tinder. A suggestion i have for them is to allow users to filtre for verified users only. You have a system that actually does pretty decent job of making sure people are real, but you arent really making full use of it."
david cervantes,"No matches, a lot of spam accounts. just as bad as Tinder"
DarkerTC,well gave it a try and well lets see its just a more feminist tinder that dose the whole you gotta match and wait for the girl to message you back on a clock lol but people have jobs and ya this app has taught me more time and again online dating apps only find you the wrong in this society and that women are spoiled and use men.
WOW XOXO,You have to pay to see who liked you! You cant talk to anyone! It is also full of fakes! It is like tinder but even worse!!! Avoid this app at all costs!
TaIsKing,Better than Tinder
Dylan Ferrari,"Asks you for money every time you get a match. Just use tinder, it's free."
In Human Creation Media,"Made a few new friends. People are much better communicators here, than on Tinder."
manas ranjan,It was better before. Way better than Tinder. But the latest update has just spoiled everything. The app has become too slow and is not working at all. Even on 4g and wifi. Complete opposite to what it was before.
zac burniston-jones,"been on this a few weeks now, gone back on and its telling me i need to upgrade , dont want to pay if i did i would just have paid to go on tinder premium , they dont tell you about this , dont download unless you only want it for a few weeks"
Evan Hauger,"Its been good, better than tinder"
Lauren xx,great app like tinder but doesn't always tell you if you have any messages. if I click on a notification it glitches and doesn't show me so I have to reload the app. not a huge problem
Harley Road Glide,"1. This app use to be so good, now it's getting worse than Tinder. I have tried to see if this app is ""cheating the system"" by swiping on people I know, them doing the same and waiting for the match that never comes. I get RANDOM matches to people I've never even seen. and 2. This app allows so many fake accounts, it's not even worth updating."
Michael Gillispie,"I like the design of this app, I guess it could be a little better. I can tell that the people on here are more real than you would see on tinder. My problem is I'm not getting any likes let alone matches. Not a female interested in me. Truth is I'm tired of dating all going online. Whatever happened to meeting singles in person? I guess that's not a thing anymore."
Nik Bistro,"The apps connection is absolutely terrible. It will cut out randomly, not update conversations and more. I know it is not my phones connection as I have already verified if it was. I just downloaded the app and had recieved a bunch of possible matches in the Match Que. I closed the app, reopened and all of them were gone! Emailed customer support asking what happened and recieved a generic response. This app needs a lot of work and I am glad I spent no money on it. Tinder is far superior."
J F,Worst app ever. Went from being able to use it to not being able to use it at all anymore a week after. Even the facebook page support is horrible my account was linked to my FB now it says something went wrong try again!! It is same message when Tinder did it to me. I swear internet privacy laws for dating sites are horrible should just bring back old fashion dating instead of these garbage hook-up apps.
Adam,"Only been on for two days and have gotten many matches and most of the girls sent messages. Seems like a good app, like the layout better than Tinder or POF!"
Lucas Maximas,"I like it, takes the pressure of sending that first message. I think tinder is better in terms of sheer volume of potential matches for example, i have had well over 100 matches on tinder in 2 weeks and only about 10 in 2 days so if it continues at that rate it would be 70 for 2 weeks (I suspect there is a boost for new members too so it will most likely end up lower than that). As a concept this works quite well and the app is easy to use, being free theres nothing to lose."
penny jeffrey,I have been on a few dates and they have been good. Definitely better than tinder.
Aniket Bhoir,Better then tinder
Jeremy J MCKEON,More substance than tinder
john journell,better than tinder
blake hosmer,great app since I was banned on tinder for no reason and theres litterly no ads
asb1,"Love this app. The user interface, the accessibility, the look and feel, etc. Far superior concept than the antiquated pof app, and just north of better than the tinder app. This app allows you to send new pics not posted in your profile, in the messenger. Plus, far more better looking and quality folks than on pof. No question! Would give 5 stars but alas, the app is trying to up sell you certain features. Lol Nice work guys!"
Isiah Hilton,"I like Bumble over Tinder because the setup is much more in depth. You can break it all down instead of reading one giant bio like on Tinder. I also like the little symbols that represent various parts of your life such as what type of engagement you're looking for, if you have or want children, your religion, tour political status, etc. Plus Bumble is more creative, diverse. I also like the idea of the ladies getting the messaging rights so they can't be harassed for no reason."
neil frankson,"Better quality matches, like 100x tinder. finally a quality match app"
Isaac Orah,"I have been on Bumble for over a week, my account is even verified but I have had only one match that I couldn't even chat with because I'm a guy. In the same duration of time and with a similar profile on Tinder, I have had over 30 matches and met one person for a date. I actually like the aesthetic appearance of Bumble but it hasn't proven to be functional yet. Whats the point of a dating app where you cant meet people? Also, the rule that women must make the first move is sexist towards men."
Art3mis,"Seems to attract a better group of people than Tinder. The only thing I didn't like is that it shows the exact city I'm in, rather than the distance. Had a few creepy conversations because of it. You can see matches if they've also swiped right, though not EVERYONE who's liked your profile unless you pay. I didn't have any problems with bugs in the app, though apparently my last attempt at leaving a review got deleted."
N. Taylor,"Would be nice if you could turn off your location in the app, but still find matches in the area you are in. Fyi, Tinder has this option..."
Shahroze Khan,worst ever. fake cards. No visibility. No quality and pathetic user interface. they've used the layout of hinge and coupled it with the swiping of tinder. not the most original idea and hence it fails across all sectors.
Clive Baxter,"So far so good. I like the concept and I hope they do more to make it more effective and differentiate themselves more from Tinder. This is very important, because Tinder is (or has become) a failing disaster. I have more faith in Bumble."
Will,"I've recieved plenty of matches on Tinder Hinge and even Bumble. However Bumble really makes you work for it in the form of a swipe marathon. This app is probably pretty solid for the female side because they match first and they seem very serious about protection. my advice is download Hinge. Classier women and it's less fake compared to Bumble or Tinder. Dear Bumble, step your game up because your app sucks!"
Sanghyun Shin,Swiping has terrible sensitivity. I would swipe left but the app would be swipep right. Learn from tinder please
Michelle Smith,"I heard about this app through a close friend and thought I'd give it a go. I've always been against dating apps, especially Tinder as it appears to be primarily about ""getting laid"". So, I thought I'd give Bumble a go. What I didn't expect was to fall in love with the first person I went on a date with. We hit it off on our first date and now are planning on getting married next year. Thank you so much Bumble, you've changed our lives forever 🥰"
john retama,met some pretty fun people here.. imo it's better than tinder
Matt Hjorth,"Their photo moderation is ridiculous, pic of you and your nephew? No. You and your dog? No. Doing a little yoga? No. On a horse? No. On a motorbike? No. Tried so many photos that were auto deleted I gave up. Stick to Tinder, much easier format"
Nitin Panwar,Its a great app with great features.. better than tinder ..
Raul Popa,"sucks, just like tinder, if you don't pay you don't get any exposure!!"
Massimo Ciamberlano,On tinder I average 7 to 10 matches a week. On bumble I'll get 3 to 4 in a month. Half the time they never even message first so it just expires. Stick to tinder
Anuj Kumar,This should be more popular than Tinder. It has better filtering and genuine people.
Alex Chadsey,"It functions like it's supposed to, and has a decent design. I mainly use it for the dating side, so I can't really say how the 'bff' and 'professional' bits work. The thing that stands out to me is the fact that women message men first, which helps to challenge a whole bunch of problematic social norms. It's basically a more progressive Tinder. The only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is the lack of space for writing bios. But that might be an intentional thing based on research."
Anshaj Goyal,On first day got 4 matches so I find it better than tinder where for 2 months I got 3 matches which did not even respond. probably bots there
jonnynace,Better than Tinder.
Dhruv Sharma,"very well for a user, better than tinder."
Justin Poland,got mad matchs compaired to tinder
Bryan Vonn,"so so , just another tinder where you swipe right or left...you don't get to write unless thay do but most of them act like they don't know this fact by reading there profile...you then wonder how many are just thinking you're too lazy of a bum to write them and put you in the dust heap. why not let you write once?? not much use in paying until you see if you ever get a response after spending hours and hours reading all the profiles.... right...after awhile you just swipe right on everything"
michael noel,"waste of time, just like tinder they say that you have matches so you swipe right on every single person but low and behold, no matches. I've found that it's a scam to get money out of otherwise desperate fools, nice try bumble, you're the worst."
Matt Bernier,"Well, it's not Tinder."
Derek Carpenter,"The worst dating app I've used thus far. Distances are inaccurate and dont account for actual traffic. Matches never contact first or respond after making contact. Having to pay to see potential matches is just a money grab for the makers and not worth the money for what you get in return. Matches expire far too soon for people to contact or communicate. Overall its just a shittier version of Tinder, and I'd give it a 1/5. Its not worth your time."
Rc Nation,"POS! don't waste your time or money. horrible experience. the women are lazy they don't talk. I've gotten way more likes matches and dates on tinder, plenty of fish."
Your comrade Ati,better than tinder and other app. I'm loving it!
Trini Mac,I like Bumble better than most other dating apps. its certainly a way better alternative to Tinder. The guys are more respectful because they know their accounts will be deleted if they're rude. women do have to make first contact but guys can decided to respond or not. There are lots of possible matches. the only thing I would say is maybe give people 48 hrs to respond to a match. life is busy sometimes!
Donovan Naidoo,the interface and overall app is great to use.Its fairly simple to get going. However the point of the app is dates of which I have had zero. It seems you need to pay to get any benefit and the profiles on this app seems like they were copied and pasted from another dating site. These profiles dont seem active at all. Which is a shame. I prefer this apps approach over Tinder but I have had dates there without having to pay.Disappointed. My profile is pretty good so it makes no sense. Zero matches
Christopher Forbus,"Bit the bullet and paid the $10 to actually see the people who matched with me, the app then told me I hadn't paid and needed me to pay again even though I have the emailed receipt. Put in multiple support tickets asking for help and received none nor can I even ask for a refund. Moving on to a different app or trying Tinder again."
Summer A. W.,"Met a lot of douchebags using women for sex or mommy with no career, no ambition, no apt, no forethought, but plenty of 🍆. They'll even show you thanks to the app's photo feature! Also only app I've encountered fakes or prostitutes on, & I had to make the first move for all of that. It's like it's designed for the guys taking care of too lazy to talk to women before sex on Tinder, just want to rake em in. If that's what you're looking for, cool. Not into rapey dates? Not the app for you."
garrett dhondt,feels better than tinder
Jared Van Cor,Its a less scetchy version of tinder i guess.
Chris Scott,"seems ok, better than tinder"
Rockstar0777,1. girls dont like messaging first 2. if they do theyre boring af 3. 98% fake profiles 4. unlimited likes and even if you like everyone you get 1 match out of like 1000+ ( trust me) 5. if you're in data the app wont work whatsoever 6. worse than tinder and tinder is horrible
B J,"Awfully pathetic. Good luck meeting anyone. Had this installed for at least 3 weeks, good number of matches - zero messages and since a woman only has a 24 hr window to message you, being busy like most adults, the window goes missed. This app sucks. Met ZERO people with it in a few week span. I would give zero stars if I could. Don't waste your time.  *** Adding to this review, as Bumble responded:  extends tied to paying a fee... no thanks.  This product does really, really suck.  Giant waste of time.  So now after not getting contacted, I'm supposed to start hitting daily extends for no real purpose?  Absolute zero point in DM you guys.  Awful product.  Basically a copy of tinder except worst."
Tristan Malone,"Not as stingy matches as tinder but get a lot of ""Hey""s but have nothing to say when you reply."
Renee Pritchard,it was a good app but didnt meet my wants in an app. i want tinder but u have to have a frickin phone number. why couldnt this be more like tinder?! anywho. great job i guess...
David Crumley,"dude, way better than tinder. almost as good as pof"
Brian James Ferguson,way better than Tinder
Anthony Hockeypuck,"better than tinder, that's for sure. But I can't edit my bio. like I edit it, and then it refuses to save, been stuck with the same bio since like October. This is kind of a major drawback.."
Tamara Casperson,"bit of fun, more quality than tinder"
Brett Murray,Bumble has some interesting improvements and additions to other apps like Tinder that have a pretty positive impact on the overall experience.
Raj Anand,Better than tinder
Harper,Better than tinder
John LSX454,You only get matches if you pay. Tinder is better
anwar sims,I really like its app it's a better then tinder 😃
Geo L,"this app is worse than Tinder, but they're both trash. $80 for 6 month. No Refund."
Nick Smyth,not to bad. better than tinder!
ZC,"This is like the better form of Tinder. Ways for people to clearly identify themselves, and people focused in relationships"
Andries Groenenberg,Basically Tinder but with questions that it asks you about yourself. Works nicely but sends way too many push notifications about stuff you don't care about ended up uninstalling because ads from the app where getting annoying.
Todd Smith,"The ponzi scheme of dating apps. Seems like a simple version of Tinder yet seems like there is 0 activity on the females side... That and we all the female members models? Odd and suspicious.. Seems entirely robotic or full of inactive profiles. Who would waste their money on extending a unactive profile? Terrible, I can't believe this makes tinder look amazing."
Matt Williams,Bumble experience is better than Tinder
Rob Nickell,Better than tinder. More users than hinge and CMB. Probably the best app to be on right now.
Prateek Khera,much better than tinder
Murtadha Al Mandalawy,100× better than tinder
D&D Towing Transport,"cuz the girl will match with you but not actually message you.. I like Tinder better, you can send a message if you match"
Brittany Widmann,Honestly so much better then Tinder
Tony Salas,Been on it for several months girls are more stuck up on here than on Tinder. Tinder has been much more enjoyable...
Sitanshu Mehrotra,"In all honesty, Bumble has been a much better experience than Tinder. The Quality of Matches(people you get matched to) is at a different level. Though like Tinder, the frequency drops if you're not a regular."
ayush sethi,Looking forward to mentioning Bumble as an app better than Tinder.
David Carden,It works. Had matches and dates. Seems better than Tinder at what it does (less Instagrammers)
Laslow 3456,i love the concept of the app. but every single girl ghost out or just unmatch so honestly not that great it just sad seeing that you have a match but uou keep getting unmatched without any girl to atleast speak to you bit. its not so different from tinder(knowing its mostly for sex)
Tenzo Heron,tinder is better
BEE HOMES,More options than Tinder
Karl Calixto Acosta,"It's actually much better than i thought. I think it's better than most apps out there like POF or Tinder. I'm already meeting real people, so...Bumble actually works. Just don't be creepy once you get a message or if you don't get any at all; maybe there's something wrong with your profile. Re-read it and be yourself."
Tom DeVito,I really love bumble! But can you at least add some sort of sound when notifications come up? Edit: Got the sounds working thank you :) and i just wanted to say you guys are SOOOOO much better than POF and tinder :D
Niassin Man,it dosnt work rlly. I think tinder is better
Michael Kowalski,Better than tinder.
Patrick,Much better than Tinder.
A Google user,finally not fake as much as tinder
Kimmo Halonen,"Better than Tinder, I just wish more people used it."
Mitchell Rankin,its better than tinder
A Google user,"Seems working, I've spent few months on it. Definetively better than tinder"
A Google user,"Easy to use. Lots of profiles to browse through. I just don't like the messaging with this app, when compared to Tinder and other like dating apps."
Used by Google,Always lagging. I have to close app then restart again. Conversations are a pain as it does this all th time. Screen freezes or just a loading screen. Cant refresh page. Cant see msg. All of these happen everytime i go on bumble. I deleted it. Tinder all the way. The whole idea of women texting first is stupid anyway. It doesnt work honestly. Ive givin this app plenty of chances. Bye bumble.
lorenzo banks,"10/10 would bang this app this app has high quality people, it's more mature, more healthy. I met a woman who has a pilots permit! That doesn't happen on tinder, maybe Okc"
George Sunny Thuruthummalil,Way better than tinder. I still dont know why tinder is more popular with this thing around.
Shashank Kaushik,"Good app. Better than Tinder. The only thing that makes it horrible, is the fact that you cannot text first and this ultimately leads to not being able to interact with someone you might actually have a chance with. why would someone pay for your services and premium features if they aren't even allowed to make the first move?"
Marianna Robles,"It's not horrible, I just don't like being the one to have to make the first move. It's very similar to Tinder."
Sean Scott,"after two years of Tinder I was absolutely done with online dating. Then a friend had try Bumble and I loved it! instead of being just one of the hundred new messages a girl receives it's on her to respond. this may seem like a small change but it truly changes the game. you can gain so much insight by someone's first response! from a simple ""hey"" which could indicate low interest to the more extensive greeting to show they're taking the time & effort for you♡ don't give up on love! just Tinder"
Carla melara,just like tinder out 13 matches 8 were looking for friends with benefits
Kamil A.,"Was Best swiping interface, until Tinder upgraded theirs. For some reason this one has a lot of hot women compared to others. The bad news is that it's very hard to get any matches, and when you do, they are not followed up on. But it may just be because I'm not willing to put too much personal info on there like my job. I NEED A SKIP BUTTON! WHY IS EVERYONE FORCING ME TO CHOOSE?!!"
GodIs Strange,really a lot of benefits to tinder
Sajal Nagwanshi,just another tinder. better go out and meet actual human beings than swiping profiles
Brad Knapp,"The quality of people in general is a little bit better on Bumble, and since the girl has 24 hours to message you, it usually leads to messaging if you match, unlike Tinder. However, Bumble is CONSTANTLY sending notifications to my phone, ads pop up with my native Text app sound on my notification bar, it will ""remind"" me 2-3 times a day to use Bumble. It seems like every time I bring it up, I'm asked to enter EVEN MORE information about myself before I can start swiping."
Kahlin Walker,"DO NOT GET THIS! Similar to Tinder, this app will tell you that you have a like/match that you can't view without paying and as soon as you purchase their ""coins,"" the like/match goes away. On top of being ripped off, you also have to sort through numerous fake profiles and scammers. Although the other functions of this app may be useful, the dating portion is a scam and I do not say that often, unless your Tinder or Coffee Meets Bagel then I do say that haha! Seriously, don't use those either."
Don Williams,there aren't alot of people on here but all the ones I have talked to have been nicer than tinder.
marc chinama,To me better than Tinder. Tinder has too many fake profiles.
CL Hawkins,"love it, better than tinder!"
Kristofer Thompson,"Much better than Tinder. Love they priortize the order of people shown. Also much less buggy. Now if only everyone would understand the rules of women having to contact first, all would be lovely 😊"
Tyler Stanley,Great app. Much better than Tinder. Foh wit dat weaksauce.
William Lang,definitely use Bumble if you are single or to just make friends. would recommend Bumble over tinder for match rates.
Petie Cavin,"Compared to tinder its marginally better but stupid for other reasons. They have the option to show you smoke weed, which is federally illegal, but locally legal. All well and good, i think it should be treated similarly to alc. But post a photo of shooting at a range, which is federally legal, and it immediately gets flagged. Just idiotic. Also tried to purchase coins and never showed up. Had to file a claim with PayPal"
Google User,this app makes me feel usless just like tinder and it doesnt help my depression been on here almost a year and you know your ugly when you dont get no matches on here or tinder yup cant get a gf in real life and i cant get one on a dating app
Cote Crowe,I was told about this app from a coworker and I am only getting 2 matches and by the time I pay the extra money so I can contact the matches the persons are gone. this definitely not the best dating site. You will be better off going on tinder or plenty of fish. You have a better chance on those sites as far as getting someone.
priyanka bidari,Much better than Tinder.
A Google user,"better than tinder, the ladies message you and most are serious about dating"
Ben Shearer,"Used it previously and have met people courtesy of it. Due to women having to make the first move it will help whittle out the nobhead guys as they're busy harassing on Tinder etc. It's ridiculous that guys are downvoting because they don't get many matches; how is it Bumble's fault if you aren't an eye-catcher? Either keep going, or try a more personality based dating app (Hinge for instance) or do something about it to be the best you you can be 🤷🏻‍♂️"
David Biasiucci,"meh, the results are less promissing than tinder."
G Lee,tinder is better!
A Google user,Decent app seemedly full of decent people. I would recommend it over Tinder.
jorge carrejo,Haven't had 1 woman respond.. I even got responses on tinder.. Not this for some reason..
YoungJames theInfinite,"This app is trash. I swiped 1,273 times and got 4 matches. I had tinder for two days and got 16 matches. Lots of fake profiles on here, profiles people arnt using, and the same profiles you already swiped on. All around a good idea, but a really crappy app."
Triona O Donnell,its a lot less creepy than tinder thats for sure
Gaurav Bansal,Perfect channel to meet a mate... Very genuine people around unlike Tinder
A Google user,tinder is so awesome. success stories only.
Vian Vaz,"""ladies always make the first move."" should be corrected to ""only ladies can make the first move"". even if a girl likes you there is a time limit like as if i have to buy a ticket. trust me guys tinder is far far better anyday."
A Google user,"love the interface, everything is so easy to see and do on this app, notifications arent intrusive, no crazy ads. Better than tinder 100%"
kamesh pratha,compared to tinder its good
A Google user,Definitely much better than Tinder in letting girls talk first.
Conner Phillips,"Better than Tinder, except it's underpopulated so not as effective."
Kyle Caldwell,better then tinder
Thandi Dube,Better than Tinder
Javier Jaimes,forget about Tinder
Lewis Kitney,Women match but dont message. Seems pointless. Tinder is better.
A Google user,So far this has been a good experience. Definitely different than the Tinder and the semi instant gratification. Notifications for receiving messages could be way better. I don't want an alert 5 hours later for a message I received 8 hours ago.
A Google user,tinder is the best this app is completely useless
Dylan Haas,"Better than Tinder, mostly because im not interested in hooking up with strangers."
Jeremy Coleman,still seem to meet a lot of flakey insecure people but not quite as much of a headache as tinder in that regard
Darius Firoz,"it takes long to meet anyone, it's a longer version of Tinder where girls choose to talk first. it's a good idea, but still needs a tweak. too many girls on here looking for nothing, it needs to be more selective I think"
Brian T.V.,lots of fun! the only other dating app that competes with Tinder! imo
Dawson Douglas,Not as obnoxious as Tinder.
rohit barthwal,I found it better than tinder...only point is you charge extra for the superlike coin..that must be given to paid member.. atleast with few..
A Google user,"People rarely write enough on their profile for you to get a feel for their personalities or interests - and without something there to connect to, why swipe right? The app seems dull, neither as fluid as Tinder or as detailed as OKC."
Connor Durall,way better than tinder. no fake profiles
A Google user,better than tinder
Peaceful Escapes,"One of the worst dating apps out there. I receive 5x as many matches on tinder and 20% of them end in conversation. If you're looking for fat women that can only utter ""hi"" then you're in luck. if you want to meet attractive women go out on the street and approach. Don't waste your money on the subscription. Too many bots and non respondents."
Max G,"Hardly any matches after first 2 days, tried the boost feature, still no matches. I think they hide your profile to get you to pay. Waste of time. p.s. I get loads of matches on tinder, so i guess its the app rather than me being ugly 😂"
Zach M,It's like Tinder but better.
Chris O'Sullivan,Does what it purports to do. Better class of date per match than tinder.
Chris Viveiros,"fair for all, good system towards matching & quality people far better than tinder & plenty-of-fakes"
Saurabh Deshpande,Waste of time. Worst filters ever. Please make sure you are not coping tinder. 2 star are only for User interface. functionality zero
Prashant Soni,"It is great app for getting date or people who are less superficial but there just are not enough people on the app . I am a guy and on tinder I get around 10 matches every hour and 8 of which are not bots, but I don't hit anyone on intellectual level. On bumble I get 10 matches in a day, but I know that I will have fun on dates. Again it is not to say your pics don't matter rather this app gives you quality people to date with."
Bob Snow,Much better than Tinder
Donald Silvey,pretty decent better than tinder or pof
AJ Daoust,"Better than tinder, only slightly."
Michael Hoselton,"No criteria/matching features, very limited profile, so it gives a very Tinder/hook up vibe. Only women can send messages, but only have 24 hours to do it, so you'll almost never talk to anyone. Surprising number of profiles used the limited space to indicate their desire to murder public employees."
François-Olivier Lauzière,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD! YOU NOW HAVE TO PAY OR YOU WON'T HAVE ANY MATCH! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! EDIT : THEY CONTACTED ME TO SAY THE APP IS FREE, EXCEPT NOT A SINGLE GIRL LIKED MY PROFILE IN WEEKS, AND I USED TO HAVE AROUND 5 MATCHES A DAY GO GET TINDER INSTEAD!!!"
Nick Nickerson,"This is the absolute worst dating app out there for men. If you're below average, don't even waste your time. Women only swipe right on hot guys, your bio means nothing and they'll never know your personality. Its the same as tinder but you cannot send messages as a guy, the women have to message first, so you will never get a message unless you're an 8/10 slayer. Also, inactive profiles and blatantly fake profiles oversaturated the site, so you're swiping right for no reason. 0 stars 0/10"
K Roeh,"(update: bumble suggesting to use Twitter or facebook is trafficking it's users to websites that are known to sell users data dropped rating by 1 star.) The same profiles keep coming up, but nowhere near and scamming and defective as tinder. miles above tinder. making women text first is the best feature even though they don't have much to say even though they expect men to just blow them away. tinder is a ghost town of women just trying to get you to follow them on Instagram."
Josh Liang,The 24 hour cap is killing me. I haven't been able to respond to 3 different people in the last week because I forgot to check the app. I'm going back to tinder instead of dealing with what bumble has to offer
A Google user,it is some what better then Tinder
A Google user,shocking i like lot girl like tinder pof nothing what point delleting the all nothing something not right i think i only want date
Phillip Trottier,"I gave them a 1* Review based off my previous experience; after consideration, I've revised my opinion to include their support staffs assistance. I'd be willing to give 4* upon further improvements to the app down the road, but current valuation seems appropriate. TL;DR Bumble > Tinder"
Stuart K,"i used bumble for less than a week. As an app, I'd rate it a bit higher than Tinder. I liked the expanded profiling. I will say that I am pretty sure I was matched with someone I didn't swipe right on but can't be certain. For a platform designed specifically to empower women and encourage respect? Meh. The users did the opposite for me. Aside from the expanded profiling, no real difference compared to tinder."
Ben Milne,"Well, it's not tinder."
A Google user,"As a man it's cool to not have to be the one to make the first move for a change, questioning sometimes whether or not the woman is even into me. Bumble takes the guess work out, and the constant ""hey how's it going"" we face as dudes on other sites, and it's less likely for your messages to get buried like on Tinder. If you 2 match, she has 24 hours to hit you up first... because she wants and chooses to. It's fun and nice to be pursued. Just be friendly and respectful."
traC zO,the 24 hour expiry is needless and unhelpful. its why tinder is better
A Google user,"Thank you for being there for me when the options were vast and abudantly available using the best messaging system ever!! This app can't be compared to tinder at all, bumble is in another whole level when it comes to app user agreement with the apps. 9/10 will tell my grandkids about how i met their mother. p.s. i'm still single :("
Jogging 4 skittles,nothing but fat single moms... if I wanted those I would go to tinder...
Kevin Hogan,"Pros: free service, user friendly like Tinder but unlike Tinder has fundamental questions suggests people answer outside their bio like whether or not want kids or have kids, etc. Cons: The few questions are all optional but in my opinion important for filtering interests, some write very little in their bio. Like other dating sites you sometimes get matches who only wanna chat but not go out on date kinda defeats the purpose."
Simon Le Beau,100% better than tinder
Michael Prevot,better than tinder
A Google user,"This app is garbage, really. The time limits destroy its usefulness. Got a few dates out of it but far less than any other dating app. Tinder is by far the better option."
A Google user,Definitely better than Tinder!
Benjamin Solomon,better than tinder.
pablo espinal,Pretty good app. Specifically for me it's better than Tinder and other dating apps available
Bit Fu,"Better and far better than rest of the apps.. Face recognition to verify, the liked profiles does not appear once again.. Its look genuine and true.. Not playing with users like rest.. TINDER THE WORST APP.. BUT WHEN THERE IS A MATCH GIRLS DEFINITELY WILL NOT MAKE A MOVE.. SO PLEASE GIVE A CHANCE TO US ATLEAST FOR A WEEK OR MORE.. IF IT A MATCH.., girls will never take the chance.. I guess.. According to my research.."
A Google user,"Terrible application. Once you register they bait you into spending money to buy premium to see who has has already liked you and it turns out to be a bot/moderator. Spend 2 days Litterly just liking every single woman, not a single match. Downloaded Tinder and oh look within 10min I was already talking to a woman who is not only within 3 miles from me, but also is not a moderator or a bot. I'm not sure if the app is just buggy or full of dead accounts. Won't ever use it again. 🤷‍♂️"
Vishukumar Poojary,"Nice app I think better than tinder, it is working for me."
Justin Lenzi,This app has a wide assortment of gay men and I'm enjoying the interface. Too many twinks on tinder.
Grizz_ 567,Constant notifications begging for money. Greedy and money hungry developers. Don't waste your time .Download Tinder if anything.
Andrew K.L.,"better than tinder,"
James Jodoin,ive found this site to be much more responsive and respectable then most other flash in the pan apps (tinder) and some quality people ive mos def been fortunate enough to meet with..
Daniels Forges,better than tinder if ur looking for cute girls
Suzanne Lewin,so have only been on here a week or so but so far I'd say it's way better than tinder or pof or any other dating app. The fact that woman have to message first saves all the random and strange messages and seems to have a better quality of men!!! dont get me wrong your still gonna get wrong ones on here but can filter them out fairly quick with the 24hour response time so overall I think it's one of the better dating apps given power to the women.
ryan jagessar,awesome app! better than tinder!
A Google user,"overall, probably more wholesome than Tinder"
Louis Derry,I've had next to no success in meeting anyone from the app using a replica profile that on tinder has probably got my 80. matches and numerous dates. If your standards are low or your going for 40+ then Bumble might be for you. Other than that the app is total waste of time.
Ian Williams,"Little more than Tinder with more info, but men arent allowed to take initiative in an online space where women refuse to do the same."
Gene Smith,better than tinder
A Google user,I like it a lot more than Tinder. People seem to be more interested in dating than hooking up. They've ironed out the bugs from the last time I tried installing the app.
Karate kid,Belongs in tbe garbage with tinder. 👎👎👎
Precisionist One,"The cencors for this app are total picture NATZIS! THAEY CLAIM YOU HAVE TO SHOW YOUR FACE CLEARLY BUT IF YOU ADD ANYTHING, ANYTHING TO MAKE YOURSELF STAND OUT, LIKE EVEN A STICKER NEXT TO YOUR FACE, THEY WILL REJECT YOUR PIC IMMEDIATELY ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT DOESN'T SHOW YOUR FACE CLEARLY. THEY ARE COMPLETE F***TARDS AND FULL OF SH**. THEY DON'T WANT YOUR PIC TO STAND OUT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SELL YOU ADD ONS TO BOOST YOUR PROFILE. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MIGHTY $$. USE TINDER, MEET ME, POF INSTEAD!"
Monica Schmitz,"The concept of this app is better than tinder but there are several glitches & obvious things that are off. A large # of women are highly successful & maybe this is just me but dont need a dating app, the chats randomly get deleted, we have had plenty of matches but most dont seem real, the convos that we do have are short & basic mostly, I think the app is matching some profiles 4 ppl, a lot of the women are on to get Instagram followers & aren't serious about dating. Theres just to many issues"
Cameron Schaible,better then tinder!
Otto de Jesus,Girls are friendlier here than Tinder. Had a couple of snobby one but they're blocked now lol.
JIM PANTELAS,I'd say one of the best dating apps although tinder will stay in our hurts...
warren gibbons,Don't like matching with ads or ghosters the apps full of them it use to be great for meeting people but has gone downhill like tinder and I will not pay to match with someone who liked me 2 months ago just let me match with them normal without forking out £12 month for features thtt should be their
Ashutosh Vyas,forget tinder best is here
A Google user,horrible app ...there seems to be nothing but fake profiles and ads...this app is worse and more unrelaible than tinder..and that is saying something
Ivee Sanasinh,i think its glitchy. seems like every match and convo that happens seem to drop off the earth for no reason. even when i matched the same person on tinder and they would answer there and say they didnt get a message on bumble. plus you cant erase some of the profile questions. why would you not let users delete?!?
A Google user,So much better than tinder
Ro ML,"Great app! gives you way more info than tinder (hight, sign, smokes or not, etc) and I love that there are only 24 hours to talk or the match goes away, because it is a great incentive to connect. In tinder match can rot without interaction. Good job guys!"
Osama Madlom,Decent alternative to Tinder.
Austin Sanders,I've talked to so many people and have had great results. Even if we dont talk after the app they have all been kind and respectful and an actual real sincere person. This is better than Tinder for sure!
deepesh singh,in a way better than tinder....
zerick89,"compared to POF, tinder, and okcupid In my opinion best app out there. the woman have to write you first, considering that.. still in my experience way more chats and dates than any other free dating app"
jean-paul stavro,tinder is way better to many problematic issues
A Google user,best app I've used so far you actually have a conversation with people who aren't being overwhelmed with messages.. might delete tinder and all other pointless apps where you send a message and get ignored
Barry Omohundro,better than tinder by far. class
Alyssa Seymour,"Concept is great! Easy to use! Hoping it was way better than tinder but it's pretty much tinder. Not their fault, it's the clientele!"
xxrookyxx,"Its obvious that after their last update the only way to get matched is by paying. I used to get atleast a few matches a day and after the update, 0. Atleast tinder baits you into paying. Bumble is just false advertising"
Shivam Jaiswal,if someone have liked your profile why ask for money...? no where near tinder it is
Kenneth Chennault-Wright,I'm satisfied more then tinder
Isaac Napoleon,better then tinder...
Steve Walker,"This app lies, and the matching is horrible.  This app tells me, frequently, that someone has shown interest and I need to start swiping to see who it is.  That's a lie.  If I swipe right (like) the next 100 people, it won't result in a match.  That means either Bumble is refusing to show me the person who liked me, or no one did, and the notification about it is completely fabricated.  Even when one does match, most women will either let the match expire, or will say just enough to ensure they keep all their matches, but then never send a message after that.  Matches aren't based on chemistry like on OKCupid, they're based on superficial judgements and window shopping.  This might be better than tinder, but it's still a scam to collect money from people who fall for their BS marketing and can't see that their premium features are a waste of both time and money."
Matthew Davison,better then tinder
Thomas Nguyen,better than tinder
Jared Goodrich,"better than tinder, more respectable it feels"
Richard Morley,"I like this site. It has a nice interface, and I especially like that it puts women in the driving seat in initiating conversation. Seem to be a nice range of people on it too...mire respectable than Tinder!"
A Google user,"Better than Tinder, i see a lot of complaints about people not responding. You get that on all of the platforms. I like ladies talk first as finally there's a bit of equality 👍and it makes Bumble stand out from the rest. I also like the 24hr limit on a match, some will use it like tinder and play the game of averages. I don't pay for the app and i still get matches, chats and dates. If you get a notification someone has matched, then it disappears, chances are they have deleted you from match"
HEY_ZEUS 15,better than tinder imho
Michael Cruce,"Bumble isn't that bad of an app. They make it easy for shy guys like me who likes women, because women has to make the 1st move, unless you are a homosexual. Then you or the person can message 1st.They also arent as bias as Tinder in regards of political view differences, unless you upload a meme bashing feminism then they will give you a warning and then delete the meme photo or what you wrote in your profile about it. If I had more matches I would of gave them 5 stars. Forget Tinder use this."
Aaron Heaney,Keep running out of people to swipe on even though the app says i have several people who have liked me. After two weeks I am yet to find match with these people. Whats the point of this app if they allow people to like you but prevent them some showing in your searches so you can match unless you pay to see them of course. Its a pay to win mechanic and it sucks in a dating app. Tinder is terrible but at least you match and talk to people on it easily.
broken glasses,"The app let girls to do the talk first if they're interesting in you, so if they just accidentally liked you and you got matched, she could avoid you even if you extended chat time. Got a match before in like months but failed and never another second match, a lot less than on Tinder and CMB"
Annel Coetzee,less user friendly than tinder
Dharmesh Parmar,Very similar to Tinder... Dunno whats really different... But a nicely developed app and not a cheap rip off... Hope gives a few better features soon
Chase Mura,better then tinder
Adrián Elizondo,Better than Tinder!
Becca Lacroix,Trash! Complete trash! Tinder is free. If you wanna get ANYWHERE on this app you have to pay. Switching back to tinder!
Preston Faulk,better than tinder
Daniel,girls are alot better looking than pof and tinder
Josue Diaz,Awesome app. Seems like the Tinder crowd migrated over to Bumble. Theres a ton of activity. Haven't noticed any spam accounts. Easy to use.
jeremy theis,definitely a better experience than tinder.
Jade,"Terrible. Not worth it. Waste of money, if you pay to see the people that like you - its not as good as tinder gold because you can't view their entire profile and you only are limited to seeing the most recent 9 people. To see more you have to manually remove them one at a time."
Joey Love,better than tinder
Ariel Johnston,"Ive been on bumble before and i liked it more than Tinder. I deleted my account and returned a month later making a new account. Also went back on my tinder. Two weeks back on both i got 70 matches on tinder and none on bumble. Then i get a message captioned ""Want some extra shine?"" I click on it and you want me to buy coins to get spotlighted. I will be deleting this app."
Joseph Budzban,same as tinder never match with anyone and on the rare occations thst i do they never send the first message like the app wants. rather be single all my life at thia point.
Daniel Ray,good idea for a app but the actual use of it is a waste of time. disappointed for in app features and has bugs. when I emailed about the issue they had some lame excuse and didnt fix the problem. will probably go back to tinder very soon.
Manav Saini,It's better than tinder. we get more matches. what else could men ask for? 😊
Jp Zampetti,better than tinder however the girls must message first and it falls through alot of times
Brayden vesely,Fun just as addicting as tinder to be on!!
Edward Harmon,"I like that there are filters, unlike Tinder, as well as more detailed profiles. It's a bit exhausting as a male in an already small dating pool (polyamorous) to swipe a bunch when you know most won't be interested. I don't like that the super-like button bounces. It makes me think there's one available like Tinder's daily one, but it just brings up the shop."
cameron harrison,boost etc twice as expensive as tinder lol
Rousseau Chanda,I like it better than tinder!
TJP,"What's the point of carefully crafting a message for a ""match"" when they almost never respond? Or respond and then immediately vanish? Just as bad as tinder."
Jay,more in depth than tinder
avalancher 30,I like the set up alot better then tinder
Garritt Harris,it's better than Tinder
Chris Moes,"App is easy to use. Profile is easy to set up. I like that you can verify your account, feel like there are fewer bots than Tinder. Why is distance at the very bottom? It sucks to get to the bottom of a girl's profile and find out I've got an hour+ of driving if I want to get a cup of coffee. Distance to the top and it would be 5 stars. I dont use the paid features, so I cannot comment on how well they work, or if they are worth the money."
david daniel,seems less scummy than tinder and other dating apps
A Google user,aren't doing good on Tinder ? Bumble is by far the best dating app I've yet to find
Sawan Lather,Better than tinder and other apps
seventoz,"Better than Tinder, girls go first"
harshal parab,App is okayish i mean the user interface is the best i liked obvio better than tinder i found a match but women making first move is like dumb.. I mean i found a match after swiping like dozens of profiles and to wait for her to make 1st move is like waiting forever.. I would suggest to remove 24hr timer thing.. nobody wants to lose their precious match!! Without even getting a chance to talk to each other..
Marlon Cameron,Better than Tinder.
Sam Grosso,solid app def better than tinder if your not trying die
William Delboni,Paid features too expensive. Even Tinder is cheaper.
A Google user,"it's like Tinder but seems ""nice,"" more gentle and gives info about the person. so far, I really like it."
Paul Berry,"Vast improvement on Tinder the whole culture is different. Also basic stats type questions: 'looking for..?' etc. are extrodinarily helpful esp. for ppl who aren't into the full on traditional relationship; helps tons w time, hurt and communication"
Mohsin Yaqoob,so much better then tinder
A Google user,"tells you that yiu have a bunch of matches, then places them all at the bottom of a queue so that even after days of swiping right on everyone, you still wont find them. Same boring formula aa tinder, designed to get desperate people to pay premium just so that they can get ghosted by the girl of their dreams"
christopher roberts,The search algorithm for bumble is awful. It does not display the people who have liked to leaving you to swipe for hours with no results. Tinder has a far better algorithm. The paid service would allow you to see the likes but it's grossly overpriced. Overall quite a poor app. Changing the algorithm to show those who liked you first would fix things.
A Google user,honestly im doing better here than on tinder
Doug Kautenberger,"Better UI and fewer bugs than Tinder. My only complaint would be that it feels bloated with inactive accounts which just makes it a tad annoying. Otherwise, an enjoyable experience."
Ariel G,a million times better than Tinder
Troy Nostrand,"I really like this app. unlike its competitors tinder or pof, this app has potential. in two days of using this app I have had long meaningful convos with people that are interested in getting to know me and want to meet in person. highly recommended.👍🏼👍🏼"
Pinky Garcia,I like the way it's set up compared to Tinder :)
Nick Von Aschen,better than tinder
Phillip Hutton,I've tried match and tinder. by far this is the dating app that gets the most serious chicks to talk to you. Tinder inundates the chicks with messages. They literally have no time to check the messages. With bumble the ones really interested reach out to you. So you know they are interested in you.
Marcus Aurelius,better than Tinder
firdaus ahmad,much better than tinder
Rachel Dyer,this is so much better than Tinder. people can give more information about themselves. the 24 hour limit stops people from swiping for instant gratification. I've been able to have better matches and conversation this way. no harassment yet. does need improvement in some areas but otherwise better than most other apps.
A Google user,better than tinder
A Google user,Tinder is in trouble!
ella c,better than tinder ...way less trashy and chill
Michael Szwajkosz,"wayy prettier girls than tinder, & not stuck up as well & down for some adventures 👍💯"
Prasanna Lakshmi,I found same list of profiles from Tinder so Its disappointing. Most of them are married folks looking for hookup.
david north,"having to wait on the women sucks , o have extended for them to only drop off , alot of ghosting , people don't want to meet ,this seems worse than tinder and booty call aps"
Doctor Boredom,"I like the format better than tinder, but I have yet to see any results after a month of use 😅"
JoshxDarnxIt,"This app works fine, but I get significantly fewer interactions in it than I do from Tinder."
sharmaji ka Beta,better than tinder
Jason,better than tinder
A Google user,"For some reason, Bumble doesn't have a non-binary gender option and limits how often you can change your gender. And the verification process seemed to struggle with my photos before finally going through, but now the verification got reversed. Otherwise, this app has a better feel overall in contrast to Tinder. I feel like I'll experience less toxicity here. I'll use Bumble for my masc days and Tinder femme days."
Gabriel Diaz,Don't waste your time. An app based on ideology that woman will initiate contact. They don't. We are different. This app proves it. I get matches on Tinder every day. I wonder who lost all their money on this destined to fail app
Shaleha Deen,i downloaded it for bumble bff. i really like the idea but the interface is not the easiest to get to. it should be the same as tinder or instagram. also super annoying feature to have is how your matches expire in BUMBLE BFF.
Jacques De Jager,better than that bot infested IG spamming Tinder
Emilia Fisk-Ndah,"Really enjoying Bumble thus far, and have actually made many more genuine connections on this than on the rival sex driven tinder 😁 definitely give bumble a go if you haven't already!"
A Google user,"Great app! Currently my fave out of all the others (POF, OkCupid, Match, Tinder, etc)"
Jonathon Andrews,"worse than tinder, more expensive, and will not work with you if you have issues. I didn't realize they would charge you for a 6 month subscription all at once, instead of monthly like tinder and other apps, and having hardly used it over 5 days I noticed the payment and contacted them only to get a message saying the listed it on the payment page and ""I hope this helps"". no help, just saying I was wrong and now I'm locked into a subscription that I just used for the first time that sucks."
Andrew Yang,"Better than Tinder, i think."
J DJ,Love this app better quality people than tinder for sure
A Google user,it's a good go to if u ever get banned from tinder
pukka,very nice app so far! 4 matches texted me on the first day! definitely better than tinder!
Sarah Tatman,It's been great so far. Similar to tinder but confusing to learn at first. The app tells you that there are people interested in your profile then when you click on it wants to make you pay. Turns out you just havent matched with those people but once you match then you can message for free and if they respond in 24 hours
Tony Eaton,This app is horrible unless you're going to pay. It purposely keeps you from matching with people but tells you that you can match with them if you pay their ridiculous fee. Atleast tinder still gives you the shot to match with people when you swipe through everyone. This app makes sure you wont match unless you pay.
D T,just get tinder
Raghav Sharma,"i found the app to be better than tinder. the crowd is way better here, and the better insights into the persons personality with all the questions the app asks you, is so much more helpful. great!"
Philip T,"Kind of like tinder, except even less useful."
atul dhingra,Better then tinder
Rya Hawks,"more like a hive with colony collapse disorder!!!! As a female on """"feminist"" tinder"" i found this app dehumanizing did not want to pay capitalists for ""better"" matches, EVERY time the app hit me up for cash i wondered how much they were ripping off the guys. Uninstalling -dont worry boys Im sure the app will keep my profile as a SEXY BOT and you can still flirt with the digital shadow of my frustrated single avatar as i left it 1-2019."
Brenton Verhoogt,"concept is good, much better than tinder. load times and performance can occasionally be an issue."
Mike Puckett,Better than Tinder!
Chris Peeters,It's pretty good opportunities versus tinder. Still waiting for my future wife to introduce herself
Tim Johnston,better than Tinder and OK Cupid.
with $100). Not worth it, still had better luck on tinder and OKcupid 
Jean-Michel Maheu,"The app works well, does what it says on the tin, has a more cultured user database due to its intentional limitation. However, I'd give it more stars if it didn't have one of the slowest image loading engines around - including retrieving images from Insta. (And no, it's not my net connection. Tinder loads images in 1/10th the time). Thank you."
Violet _,"tinder 2, this time its worse. entirely excludes nonbinary people."
Joel Anderson,I think the app is much better than tinder although been here for 7 weeks and still no date. Haha
A Google user,better than tinder. this app could definitely be priced better for in app purchases. otherwise it's a good app. I've definitely had good conversations in a short amount time.
Aniket Gaikwad,"better than tinder..but still long way to go in online dating..cyberspace is more trustworthy thanks to bumble but it can still improve the matches..even here,women get too much importance just like in tinder..as a man,online dating is frustrating as always"
Nathan Frantz,Hotter girls than Tinder
Mark Belak,not as gross as tinder
Angel Castro,"The team that runs this app is very lazy and careless to say the least. I was banned for using the word ""fat"" to describe myself in my bio (for comedic appeal). Funny because I actually got banned before I could even make a match (had the app for less than a day). Had zero interaction with anyone. And they refuse to give me my account back or let me use this app. I'll stick to tinder. This app is worthless. They let a computer determine wether or not I kept my account, and put no real effort in."
Camille Scarlett,This app is HORRIBLE. I was accused of being a catfish even though my pictures were verified and BUMBLE permanently banned my account. They straight up banned me from finding the love of my life. So many cute guys on there that needed a little love from the snack that is me! Now bumble has robbed these men the chance at true happiness and Bliss all because they are haters!! Worse app ever behind Tinder.
Kyle Alaniz,Better features than tinder for sure but feels like less matches and people though.
Anant Jain,"completely useless, if you can't see the massage sent by your match within 24 hours, they'll not allow the user to even see the profile of the match and demands a paid package just to open the profile, bumble shouldn't be this much money minded in the initial stages, I am a gold user of tinder. I can see a very less chances of sustainability of this app, and it stands nowhere if somebody compares it with Tinder. deleting it"
Yeshwanth Kumar,"the app is good, actually got a match on this app within a week of downloading it. got nothing on tinder from a year. its not amazing but its worth a try."
Jack Dalton,horrible many fake accounts and the idea of women sending the first message is a joke none of them do. very disappointed in this app. Do yourself a favor and just download tinder
Crow Boy,poor mans tinder
Queen Cecelia,Better quality men than Tinder.
A Google user,It was just like Tinder. But you have the choice to talk to someone or not.
Jacob Marten,"It's Tinder without all of the thots and players. There are actual decent people on here that are actually looking for a variety of relationships. You can search potential matches with relevant filters, women have to message first (which gets rid of that whole ""impress me with a joke or I'll unmatch you"" game), and so much more. It's what Tinder should have been. The only downside is that premium costs more than on Tinder, but it is also less necessary to match with cool people."
Nicholas Herrington,it's nice talking to real girls as opposed to the huge amount of bots you come across on POF. also the fact that the chick has to initiate the conversation is awesome. so much better than Tinder where you can have all kinds of matches and not once speak to any of them
Joshua Eudave,beats tinder
Ashwin Kumar,i like it better than Tinder
A Google user,it's cool so far. more detailed than tinder
Justin S,"Hands down way better than tinder, women aren't as greasy, a much classier set of female creatures. I can tell you I've gotten a ton of ass with this app, thanks bumble! 😎"
Rishikesh,its just a downgrade version of tinder... and it compels women to message within 24 hours otherwise the match expires... that's the only difference....i thought it was free... why did this pop up when i searched free apps... its not free
Rudresh Parshetti,"Linked in, facebook, tinder all in one but did not like it."
Sneha Arora,"I have installed and reinstalled the app so many times but it doesn't work. others can see my profile but I can't see theirs. I have even complained, reporting the technical issue but no use!it seems better than tinder though in terms of quality of people and genuine interests"
Aidan O'Reilly,Best dating app. Way better than PoF and more successful than Tinder
Harry Fryer,It's... OK. It's a good idea in theory with one fatal flaw: nobody uses it. Tinder is ultimately the only dating app people actually check and use. The fact that the girl has to message first only adds to people not responding or using it. It's a shame.
Jon Snow,"Better than tinder by far, pretty good idea as a dating app to have women message first, however the time limits on conversations ruin many many potential connections. There should be a 48 hr time limit or even a week, not 24hrs. For people saying there are 'fake' people on here who dont talk, i havent run into NEARLY as many on Bumble compared to Tinder which is chalk full of dummy profiles and women who dont ever respond. Another pro: Bumble always seems to ve adding features and improving."
Ken Hinson,"It's a RIP off!!! Scammed me out 79.99, no refunds, no prorated refunds. Don't do it. All the same people on Tinder. Never again!!!"
Kylan Marquez,tinder is better
Matt Stewart,"i have used several dating apps daily for over a year now. bumble is a bunch of BS. Unlikely to get match than other apps. half of the women that right swipe on me never message me even though i use extends. 3/4 of the half that does just say ""hey"". Maybe get 1 match a month on bumble where we actually get to the point of chatting. for comparison, i get a match that chats back on tinder about every 3 days. Also, it says i have 2 people in my match queue but i have swiped out for 3 days straight"
A Google user,I like this app way better than Tinder or POF.
Adrian Raclariu,better than tinder
Rave DeGrave,Ugly. Girls are ugly. Barely ever message. Doesn't even come close to Tinder.
Shubham Sharma,it actually works. better than Tinder which is so over rated and gets no matches at all. Good work team Bumble! :)
Michael Ashworth,Better than tinder
Coco Joelyneé,"Fraudster guys on Tinder from 5 years ago. they claim to make it ""safe"" yet every guy I matched wanted to come to my house! Really? hadn't used the app a full week. Also, if this is so safe why do guys lie about their lifestyle and occupation? basically, if your smart and pretty there will always be Haters. Next... ok developers, you gave me the same response. I think you kicked me off because those guys were caught in minutes of their fraudulent activity."
Eric Crossley,"Unlimited likes, probably better than Tinder"
Mark Wright,tinder for adults
Vaibhav Jain,"Unable to verify my identity, tinder is best"
Antoine M,Bumble should let you share profiles like Tinder.
Beth Meyer,so much better than tinder
Erik Heiser,"Don't use Tinder. Bumbe is classy, without the bots and scammers. Puts control in the women's hands so they're comfortable. No real complaints from me. The only dating app I use now, but I'm yet to get a date from it."
Robbie Briggs,they have to message first so i dont feel like im just part of a flood like tinder lol
Skullivan Gaming,ive met a lot of nice people on here thought it was going to be like tinder but i was pleasantly surprised that its not
Jordan Hernandez,better then tinder
Calvin Glaser,better than tinder
Vidal Amador-Flores,way better than tinder
A Google user,"The UI/UX of this app is far better than many of the other dating apps I have tried. Paired with that, I have had a bit more luck holding conversations with matches, as they have to initiate. Overall, better than Tinder."
Adventurous Covers,"This app is easy to use and not so ""pay for dates"" like Tinder has turned into"
A Google user,"UI is basic and intuitive, everything flows well and works basically like tinder. As a guy, I appreciate that the girl is the one who initiates the conversation, as I use the dating side of bumble, I appreciate that I can know off the bat if there is interest in a relationship or leave it at that. Havent tried anything beyond the dating side but Im not sure if proffessionals are looking to meet employees off of an app marketed as a dating app. 10/10 Dating app Meh everything else?"
ana t2568,"I find Bumble easy to use , yet it offers enough information about the people you are about to meet , plus the fact that the lady has to contact the man first is great ! in tinder people ""match"" with you and they never say hello ...here you don't feel is a bad idea to say hello first bc it's the only option , also accounts are verified so you know the person really exists and looks like their pictures, you have basic information too ! great app ! 😊🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
Suzanne Pearson,"So far it has been worth switching from Tinder. The quality of possible partners are higher and most men are actually looking for a partner, not a one night stand."
Gaurav Kapoor,How about only verified accounts are allowed to browse through the app? If it doesn't this app will soon become like tinder were fake profiles have taken over completely.
Kyle Refinski,"It's better than Tinder. Bumble only forced women to say 'hi' first. After initial greetings, the male must carry the conversation."
A Google user,ive met numerous of girls of here tbh none catfished suprisingly. much better than tinder ;)
Michael,app is okay but I've gotten about 15 matches and 3 messages in the past year where on tinder it's about 300 matches and plenty of messages. dead app
Mauricio Ahumada,great app. found it to work much better than tinder.
UrieL AzazeL,this app makes tinder look like it was designed by toddlers. if you want only 5 swipes per 24 hours download tinder ..if you want to infinetly swipe without being limited download bumble. bumble is soo much better than tinder .i had tinder for 2 months and never got a match (even wen i swipes yes for ads i didnt even get a match lol) now that i have bumble i get 4-5 matches PER DAY!! no bug issues like tinder.ajd the profile options make way more sense. download bumble 4 a better app experience!
John Hoff,Better than Tinder
Calum Lynch,much better than Tinder
Shruti negi,"dissapointed tinder,happen far better than this"
Logan Jones,Everything is based off tinder. Is good but step up.
Leo Shenk,"Pretty good app, no annoying advertisement, much better than Tinder"
Logo Lingo,"There are too many joke and fake profiles. Annoying for those actually trying to use app, not as bad as tinder but still I will change to a 5 when I see a change."
Neville Kumar,"I'd have to say, so far this seems better than Tinder in all honesty. I've been having a great time on it, and while I think it would be nice to have some search filters (distance, age, etc.) I'm not really complaining"
Q P,"Complete waste of time. It's makes tinder look incredible. Been on this app for 2 months. Haven't enjoyed my experienced, in fact its given me no confidence throughout"
Kaye lucas-kavanaugh,this app has gotten much better. I love the fact that you can send pictures which you cannot do in Tinder. I can unmatched if someone is being not decent! I haven't had any glitches and if I have to uninstall and log in super easy to get back in as if I had never left!
Parth K,Good overall experience. More mature than the tinder crowd.
Raechelle McLean,It's not Tinder...why do they bother trying for 'hookups'. App tweaks out and messages are delayed. Repeats matches.
Vivek Varendra,It is better than Tinder but now I'm trying to reinstall the app and I can't! Is anybody else having the same problem?
Zak Quor,"I had Tinder for 5 years and got jack-all matches, even fewer conversations, and even much fewer dates (like 3 total). Had Bumble for a week and so far I'm talking to a few different people and the conversations are going well. Having the onus on the woman to make the first move is what really sets it apart from other online dating platforms and is great for breaking gender enforced roles."
Jon Latane,"Has lots of bugs. Even the bug reporting is broken and doesn't work! UI isnt very responsive. Go with Tinder, CMB or Hinge - they're far better!"
Adrianna Rodriguez,less creepy dudes than tinder
KillaLemz,Great app better than tinder
Harry Grisdale,better then tinder
David Livingston,worst dating/friend app I've ever seen. somehow they deleted my review before so I'll make this quick. You can't see your likes unless you want to pay $24.99 a month. Even worse than tinder... which I didn't think was possible
Lewis Babcock,better than tinder
Herman,"It's alright lots of choices fairly easy to interact with, doesn't throw the pay to play in your face a refreshing free dating services. tinder could learn alot from this app"
Brian Packer,"Solid app for meeting people, better for getting a good idea of who you're looking at than tinder, only down voting because you can't pick search areas which punishes users in rural areas or commuters or people who live on borders. I, along with approximately 4 million other people, live along the Thames River of London, 15 miles by GPS becomes upwards of 50 miles by car or other methods so matching to somewhere like Essex is pointless."
A Google user,This app is a joke of a concept. It is exactly the same as Tinder for all intents a purposes only with a less egalitarian principal and less people. Just don't bother.
Tony McLaughlin,"It's better than tinder or others at the moment but I've found the situation where matches are few and far between, and there's a heavier leaning towards pay for access I know that's how the industry works"
Danielle,DO NOT PAY FOR THE UPGRADE. I pay to see who swipes right on me & it's so annoying that it only allows you to see 11 Match Queues at a time. If you want to see your other matches then you have to manually and individually go through each profile to decline them. Tinder has a better system.
Ryan St Louis,"Notifications for texts don't work, and half of the matches I get are bots. In order to text someone, verification should be mandatory. Tinder has been more useful then this app for friends and dates."
Joe,much better quality of matches than tinder
Spc_Munguia,Tinder's rejects. Lots of angry liberal woman and single moms.
A Google user,A lot better experience than tinder.
A Google user,Women have VERY little experience starting a conversation. Majority if not overwhelming majority will only write Hi or Hey and then expect you to take it from there. So Bumble is hardly different than Tinder whose co-founder started Bumble.
A. Sharma,They have managed to make something worse and more useless than Tinder and we have to applaud them for that
Ian Burt,Better than Tinder. Has more options for customizing your profile. Just signed 2 days ago and i've already had matches and conversations.
jerel reddick,really good dating app to many people I know on tinder this app less people know about it which to me makes it the best
Johnny Rocket,Worked exactly as described. I managed to match with way more quality women than Tinder. I have since uninstalled Tinder. Bumble finally came through for me. Thank you Bumble.
Chas Biederman,works better than tinder. keep up the good work.
TacticalDoeBoy .1,Better than Tinder.
A Google user,"I've been using bumble for a couple months now and it's a fun twist given the ladies have to message first and the profiles are generally a little more fleshed out. I've had more actual conversations and meetups than other apps (looking at you tinder), and I dont know if that's luck or a byproduct of the crowd it may draw due to that twist, but if it helps makes better connections count me in"
Trevor Sleasman,amazing app finding a connection through people on here you cant find on tinder or any other dating app
Richard Catlin,To see who liked you you have to get premium. So not that much better than tinder in that regard.
A Google user,simple and better then trashy tinder
A Google user,"These dating apps are all the same. They hold your admirers hostage unless you pay for a membership. If you don't pay, you must swipe and swipe until the app ""releases"" a match from your stockpile that you can't see. Then the cycle repeats. Tinder is exactly the same, so unless you pay for the service, get ready for this nightmare."
Entertainment vyas,easy to use but BUT tinder and tunturn better
beef232,much better than tinder
A Google user,"In Joburg where I live, it really works well. The app is really different in that it encourages communication with tips and prompts. Some really good filters help narrow down to great matches. The roles reversal is also cool feature. Made some real quality matches. I really hope it grows in popularity and more users join, which is probably the only downside. Otherwise the best dating app ( of the 3 I've tried, including Tinder) I've used to date."
Matthew Tromp,I like this app its a lot easier to get a date then tinder
Archismita Choudhury,"I've been using Bumble BFF till now and it is sooooo awesome! five stars! really needed something like this in the Indian market. so many apps are just focused on dating, and i'd always thought a ""tinder but for friends"" would be something i'd love to try out! love that the whole msg by 24 hrs also - hate having those matches that are there, no conversation but just there. like why? haven't used date/bizz yet but imagining it will be good! thanks for coming to India! (finally! lol, was waiting)"
dsp yuvraaj,pathetic & very bad experience with bumble. it is a BUNDLE not BUMBLE. sorry guys I am not impressed with the app. that's why I use such words. Tinder is much better than this. thanks
Saul Alvarez Zapiain,"definitivamente mejor que tinder, mejores perfiles, gente real, salidas exitosas, gente que verdaderamente quiere conocer gente."
Rahul Shah,better than tinder
Adam Lydick,"I love the idea of making messaging opt-in to help reduce the ""creepy bro factor"". Unfortunately, Bumble falls short in other ways. (1) Profiles are basically limited to the size of a tweet/SMS. So, it's hard to get a feel for what someone is really interested in or looking for. (2) They've recently added filters, but relationship type isn't very fine grained -- no options for non-monogamy. Basically, they want to be a ""less shady Tinder"". Good for hookups, I guess."
Chris Gunn,"I'm 25, male, white, tall, and above average looking. I've been using dating apps for at least 4 years now intermittently. I've been on several dates from Match, PoF, Tinder, and one from CMB. I haven't been on a single date on Bumble and hardly ever get any matches or responses. I use the exact same pictures and bio description across all apps and spend the same amount of time swiping. The results are highly disappointing compared to several other apps that I've used, even living in a highly populated area. Why? I'm not sure. Maybe Bumble has too many stale accounts, poor matchmaking algorithms, or the fact that women have to reply first (many women are very indecisive and need the man to start the convo). Regardless, this is by far the worst app I've used and I've had success with every other dating app but this one."
James Rasmusen,way better than tinder
SeaJoe Mama,Better than tinder.
Princesa S.,"More sophisticated than Tinder, but sometimes still the same outcome."
Rita Drubek,A proper dating app as oppose to tinder. 15/10 for real encounters and for hosting people who can actually spell.
Thomas Burton Jr.,better than tinder
A Google user,what i like about the site is the ladies makes the move. plus it's super user friendly and much nicer than using tinder.
dajazman2k,The problem with Bumble is that it's in the hands of the women to make the first move. Women are obviously rubbish at this as they've probably never had to do it before. So either they say nothing or just say 'hey'. You get allot more traction on Tinder where it's down to you to open.
Flo Samus,"Bumble are now pioneering 'Vintage' online dating, in the best possible sense. Thanks, guys, for stepping away from the Tinder nightmare back to something more personal and human. The updated design came first providing a beautiful canvas for the new updates - prompts for what may be important to a potential match, basic stats like height, relationship type... And now you've added filters, so we can finally stop wasting hours of time on profiles which are, from the start, not a match.Thank you!"
Olu Akinwunmi,underwhelming app. Better luck with tinder
Carol Maldonado,has a similar format to Tinder but is friendlier to the platonic or networking user base
Carknawt,"Better than Tinder, not as good as Hinge"
Lawson Spencer,"Can't say you won't waste time on this app like tinder, but you'll waste less time."
Ray Allen,Bumble is okay. I think they have the best selection in regards to a Tinder or a POF. It used to show you who swiped right on you but now it doesn't and that's kinda lame.
Gonzales D.,Better than Tinder
Austin Boyett,The people are real and very kind. The community is better than tinder or other apps
Fisher Grubb,"This is more professional than Tinder. Nice touch for women to write first, but a number are just as lazy as guys, so match but forget. I'd prefer this to Tinder, as one has to fill out a few things about themselves, and not be so lazy like Tinder. I think it's important for women to be empowered in dating, as many fit into the stereotype of waiting for the guy to act in stead of being more proactive. Then, us guys don't know what they're into, nice to have more balance😉"
Sean George,It's great! Better than tinder
A Google user,These new bumble conversation starters are a great idea! Way better than tinder that's for sure
A Google user,I really like the idea of the app but I live in the woods and feel like most girls swipe in 5 mi radius areas so better luck for people who live in populated areas. But app is comparable to tinder and has a better idea I think with making girls talk first so guys can't spam every woman in the Internet
Justan Trudeau,Better broads than tinder.
Andrew Kish,"- Dozens of matches, no messages (fake profiles?) - Spent a few bucks on their super swipes... Huge waste - Notification spam for *shopping*?! I deleted my profile and uninstalled this spammy scam app. You should too, you'll have success on Tinder, OKC, or PoF because they actually have real users."
Mike Brandt,Nice dating app. A bit better than Tinder in my experience.
Matt Bergin Jr,"This app is not entirely a scam but it's damn close. They didn't even show my profile to anyone. I upgraded to the paid option to see who had swiped me and not a single person. I went searching online and found out they have a reputation for blacklisting men's accounts. I tried to demand my money back because I had clearly been scammed and they just said it was against their policy. So they took my money and refused to show my profile to anyone. So yeah, basically a huge scam. And if not, then it's just a terrible app. Tinder is far superior. They don't play games wtih you, they just let you swipe. So don't go on Bumble if you actually want to meet someone. You're wasting your time. Also, to anyone who might think this is just sour grapes from me not getting any dates or matches: I uploaded the same profile more or less to tinder and ok cupid and had over 10 likes within 24 hours and had a date within 7 days. So Bumble wasted a month of my time stringing me along while I could've been on Tinder meeting actually people."
Mitch Wunderlich,Pretty good app overall. Is like a cleaner version of Tinder where girls message first.
Brian K,"To many fake profiles, and girls on here that are real dont really commit to a date..tinder is easier."
Paul Manjooran,I just absolutely love this app it's way better than tinder
William Irvine,"Ehh. This has the same problem with gamification of dating rather than sincere pursuits that all swipe/match apps do. I love the concept, but it goes against our cultural norms, which makes actual conversations unlikely. It does have mostly educated women in my area, which is a big plus. It's like a middle to upper middle income version of Tinder. I honestly would rathernot need to swipe and let women message me when they want to talk."
Mauricio Starosta,Nice dating app. Not as many scams as on Tinder...
Shane Magic,Way better than tinder
Michelle Hickman,"I love this app, it's easy to use and I haven't had any issues with it yet. I actually get people who are active and respond! Much better than tinder or other dating apps I've tried recently. The people are nice and I can find very relatable matches. Thank you so much for making something that's so user friendly and easy to understand."
PurplePill Junkie,So far so good... (30s male perspective) more fun than tinder atm
Ian Thompson,"After using Tinder for a while, I think I like Bumble more. I never know what to say to women so I'm glad they have to say something first giving me something to go off of. And it makes me feel like they actually want to connect rather than tally up matches."
A Google user,"Yo idk why everyone is hating on this app so much in the reviews, I've had plenty of success with it. Here's my pros/cons at least as it relates to being a hetero guy using the dating portion of the app. Pros: + You get unlimited swipes on a free account + Girls have to message first so that's a pretty fresh change of pace that I enjoy + You get a good idea of the person's lifestyle through quick icon bio thing + Seems to be a little better for relationships than tinder if that's what you're going for Cons: - in general I've seemed to have a little more luck on tinder - it's not as picky with location settings so you'll match with girls like 60 miles away when you set max 30 Overall I'd say if more people used bumble than tinder it'd be the better app, but I still think if you have a tinder you should 100% also have a bumble."
Georgios Tsikriteas,Seems good so far. More stabile than tinder and I like the idea of women writing first :)
Reece Crump,Edit: i got some bff matchs. I guess it just needed time. I now think this is a good app for lgbt people such as myself. I think the app isn't very well set up for people with a nonbinary gender identity. The dating portion is about as good as tinder for me (an mtf person seeking men) but the BFF portion is not working so well so far. I'm a bit manish in some lights so I worry some girls may see my pics on the BFF swipes and think I'm some creep abusing the app for chats with chicks. I'm not sure if thats the fault of the people using the app or the developers for making a system that doesn't consider people like me. I'll give it a few more days and if I get no BFF matches I'm deleting and giving 2 stars.
Esmerelda Merianaldes,"Tinder wouldn't provide the police accurate information after (thankfully only) uncomfortable close calls. All the filters in Bumble make me feel that I won't have such issues. On top of that, I can find platonic, romantivand business contacts"
Casey d,"I moved to Bumble from Tinder because I was looking for a more chick-friendly dating app. I tried uploading a picture of me in a one piece bathing suit inside my hotel room, but it was flagged because you can't have indoor swimwear pictures. Ok fine. So what about the COUNTLESS shirtless man pictures I have to scroll through? Bumble also has a ""no shirtless dude unless you're at the beach"" rule but apparently it doesn't matter. Maybe one or two pictures slipped through the screening system, but it's seriously countless. Whereas I get immediately flagged for showing one thigh."
A Google user,The only dating app that rivals tinder
tyler barthel,"such a terrible app, no one meets with me and I'm not very ugly, tinder is 10 times better. don't buy anything on this app, out dosent work"
Ed Basquill,It's way more time efficient than trying to date on tinder.
Nathan Booher,"Unfortunately, the idea of dating sites and apps is to capitalize off of the inherent desire to find love, in order to make money. But as far as they do bumble isnt too bad. Certainly better than tinder"
Martin Cosgrave Personal,I get more dates of this than what i do on Tinder.
christian,Way better than tinder.
Mitali Sarkate,Best dating app. Better than Tinder and any other dating app
Dan C,I like this app. Works well. Very similar to Tinder.
Oliver Tripp,Better than Tinder
A J,"Anxiety inducing. As an introvert that gets anxiety, this definitely isn't the dating app for me, I'm more a fan of Hinge. Bumble has some good features but it's really not that different from Tinder in functionality and the people on there, aside from the fact that you have to speak to someone within 24 hours or your match disappears. I wish I could set my own timer because 24 hours is not long enough (life is busy), and also the ability to stop the constant reminders that time is running out... Basically it's just not right for me"
Erik Lorenz,Better than Tinder
Sean L,Feminist version of Tinder
Shay Smith,Definitely better than tinder
Naomi Gudino,Horrible. Just use tinder.
Scott Hanley,"Compared to standard dating apps, like POF, Match or Tinder, Bumble encourages women to take the initiative. This system seems to put both parties at ease, reduces instances of scammers & fake accounts and, well, it just seems to work!"
MacKenzie Jonson,"I love this app!! Such a great idea! Tinder but for friends! It's so hard to just make friends when you're an adult, at least for me anyways but this is making me branch out! I love it!"
Raymond LeClaire,its like tinder but more wholesome.
Dan Stone,"This app is garbage. There are no real women, they're all bots. In two years I didn't have a single right swipe. Go blow yourselves bumble, you're worse than tinder."
Tom,"Awesome. Just awesome. Better than tinder, okcupid, everything else I tried. I salut you, Bumble."
Dominic Newton,More results than tinder. Creative profile options as well. Not bad!
Dev Maheshwari,Girls never shoot first message. This is against their ego. But this app has condition girls will do first message..nd this is how all matches gone..worst App.. You can't beat tinder.. you are not even 1% of that App...
Devin C,Better than tinder and no cam girls tryna take ya moneys
Kelly Harmer,"It tells you basics of someone before you commit to liking (height, has kids, where they live etc) unlike Tinder so gets rid of a lot of dull conversation"
A Google user,I love bumble it's one if the best I've tried and it's way better then tinder
Andreea Stres,"I don't know how this app aims to reduce the sexual harassment, but my last 2 dates were complete psychos. Generally, guys are much more mysogyn than on Tinder"
Nicolas Picardal,"Thousands of girls who only want Chad, stick to Tinder, this app is pathetic"
A Google user,"I had interacted with a few women. I also have been on a few fun dates. I would get a 2-5 inquiries from women per week. However all of that changed when i put ""conservative"" under my political leaning portion of my profile. Once i did that not a single woman would say hello....... It appears that bumble discriminates against conservatives. Just like how facebook shadow bans conservatives, bumble is doing the same. Now they claim that they had complaints about me..... Rubbish, if they did then why wouldn't they notify me? There are much better dating app's out there anyways. TINDER, POF, and BADOO are much better."
B Smith,"Pegged as a ""classy tinder"" this app does exactly what you'd want. Given women have to make the first move it's a god send for guys who don't know how to start a conversation. Having to pay for superlikes and other benefits is annoying but everyone understands that poeples love lives are business."
A Google user,"Poor user interface. Relies too much on payments. Stick to tinder,"
A Google user,Cool app. Got laid more off tinder but still has obvious potential
A Google user,Better and clasier than tinder. Enough said
Andria Michaels,Much better than Tinder. The women here are a bit more serious. The message and matching featurrs are pretty cool too
Will Huemiller,Better than Tinder. Haven't tried any modes other than date yet.
Sunset Jones,"I really enjoyed meeting people off this app, compared to tinder. Feels a lot more safer since the girl has to message first"
j jackson,Its pretty cool better than tinder but kinda sexist men can't message women first and you have to pay to super like someone
Doug Patterson,"This app can be a bit buggy in getting network connection and receiving messages but overall the concept is good. I prefer it to Tinder because a) virtually no fake profiles b) woman are less likely to be non-responsive to messages An annoying element is when it has notifications ""someone has swiped right, start swiping to match"" and then tells me ""no new people in your area""."
Crobin008,Every woman that matches up with me either didnt start a conversation and allowed the time duration to run out or just outright unmatched me. I've had far better experiences on tinder than bumble...its just not a good place for people of color. I think it's far better suited for white people or individuals with a lighter skin tone.
Rachel lane,Easy to use better than tinder
brandon martin,"Wonderful app, much better than tinder in many ways. Less quantity of matches but much better quality of matches."
Hector Ramos,Basically a version of Tinder that dosen't let you waste your time messaging disinterested people. That does make it better I suppose.
Megh Bouderau,better than tinder
Paul Lewis Jr,loved this app more than tinder actually found people who respond and want to enjoy their life . i will continue to use this app and would recomend this app to anyone
Sean Taft,"This seems to have quality people on it, at least better people than tinder. But it should create a setting to not allow trans people to even show up in your ""feed"". As in; at the beginning where it asks if you're interested in men or women, it should also allow you to be as specific as ""women not trans"" or ""women by birth"" or whatever is legally acceptable to put on it. Cause every time I see a trans woman I dont even want to keep swiping. Everything is ""a choice"" now a days and I should be allowed to choose not to be bothered with it."
Da Dude,Not as many weird psychopathic women that look like giraffes with mohawks like on tinder. Thank you! Also nice that women write first! Amazing idea!!! Would give 5 stars if i got more matches.
A Google user,Kicks Tinder's ass
João C,In Lisboa it's Badoo or Tinder.
Lane Hardwick,Better than Tinder by far but that's not saying much make your own damn mind up
Christopher Murphy,Better than POF and Tinder and no spam accounts
daryl easdown,Better than Tinder. Feels less like it's withholding opportunity unless you give them money
Claire Maile,Much better than tinder! Friendly and easy to use
Declan O'Doherty,This is very disappointing. On average I'd be lucky to match with 2 people in a whole month . Any time you do there other person would either not talk and let 24hrs pass or message once then never again. Very disappointing hoped for a better experience than tinder but somehow got a worse one .
Michael Tolhurst,Better than Tinder.
Magali Vaz,"Quite similar to tinder, but more female focussed than most apps out there. They also have responsive customer service if you face issues."
A Google user,"Feminism gone mad. I've told a woman on the site I'm not interested and she reports me,then Bumble (created by 2 females ex Tinder) block me. No explanation or accountabillity,though they portray the respect and decency card in their behaviour guidelines. ""we've recieved a number of reports"" and no warning or notification after the first?? There's no accountabillity or respect for users by this site."
Michael Celis,I feel like tinder gold is better than bumble boost. Let's step our game up! Thanks
Jack Le,Love the idea. Have met some lovely people. Would be good if the initial message would be more than hey but I guess its better than nothing. I've found I use this more than Tinder
Karen G26,It's more decent then tinder
Sasha Hennequin,"No matches at all yet it keeps telling me I have people like my profile that I can only see if I pay. I loved the old version. This version sucks! If you want a decent amount of people using your app, make more features free. Uninstalled. Back to Tinder I go!"
David McDonald,Better ui than Tinder
daniel vincent,great app.... doesn't seem to contain much of algorithm ridiculousness like tinder
Rob Bona,Better than tinder
A Google user,A less functional version of tinder
Farris Lyons,"Price has gone up, quality has gone down. Bumble is now the new Tinder."
Sarthak Saxena,Muchhhhhh better than tinder
That's you,"Not bad, but not great. Still a better Tinder alternative than OC."
Royal Dana,"So much better than tinder, but!!! Girls make the first move..."
Sasha McLean,"I really appreciate the newer feature to specify what ""you're looking for"" & can see what other profiles have selected (e.g. a relationship/something casual), it saves a lot of time wasting and I will continue to use this dating app over Tinder as a result."
Lwazi Ndlovu,"app is terrible end off, your better off on tinder , all get is a bunch of matches but nobody responds"
Jonathan rocha,Waste of time..... You have to pay to use all the features. It's more expensive than tinder.
Matthew Stroud,"At first, hopeful, but in time realized it's equally as ineffective as any other dating app. -- Functionally it's a reskinned Tinder with some cool gimmicks. In my experience Bumble boasts roughly equal results so don't expect this to be the alternative you needed from Tinder if that's the goal of the download."
Tyler D,The ability to see who you swiped right with would be nice. Overall better than Tinder
Tameem Alam,"Just get Tinder, better quality over there...this app is trash."
Jason Wolfe,Easy to use and matching is a lot better than tinder
A Google user,"Great app for dating, similar to tinder but ads other alternatives such as making friends"
Michelle Mullins,Better than tinder
A Google user,"The ""girls text first"" feature is horrible. Everyone knows woman almost never make first contact, and so you see matches happen and they disappear after the 48 hour extend. Beyond that, this app has very few users compared to Tinder. Every 8 - 10 Tinder matches (that I can actually speak to, with no time limit) to my 1 Bumble match that I can only look at for a day or two before it disappears. This app blows."
sbsp13668,"It's just tinder with less dick pics; just as shallow, selfish, and cold-hearted. Deleted this app hating myself and hating the world more than I had when I installed it."
Phillip Lampé,"Give women the 'power' by letting them start the conversation? Lol wow so creative. What do the women even do with this 'power'? Start every conversation the same way they get upset at guys for: ""Hey"", ""Hi"". Bumble is just a 1st world feminist version of Tinder: Whack af."
Rahul Wadhwa,Better than Tinder. For now.
Jonny,"Way better configuration then Tinder. In this day and age of equality,it's nice to see that females have to msg first! Lol"
Geoff Rathbone,It's a dating app. Slightly different cried than tinder.
Paul Nagy,"Honestly, I've tried a few dating apps in my time and so far this one has been the most successful. The premium features are helpful just not worth the price, I don't think. I really like the idea of putting the ball in the women's court and letting them initiate conversations, that's definitely a unique feature and so far I've had the most interactions on this app as opposed to others like POF, OKCupid, or Tinder. Is it perfect? No. Is it preferable? Absolutely."
Steven Marzolla,Better then tinder.
Mark Introna,I was very pleasantly surprised to find you can actually make a good connection on this. Far superior to tinder.
A Google user,My favourite dating app especially as a woman. Compared to tinder and others I think it's the most authentic and isn't full of loads of fake profiles ! I think the fact that women have to start the conversations makes it unique ✨❤️🙏🏾
Kevin Eckert,"Basically Tinder but women go first. Loses several stars for the annoying, passive aggressive notifications the app sends about how I should be messaging people I've already messaged"
TheRooSkittler,Just as useless as tinder
A Google user,Better than tinder
Pankaj Chauhan,"Need improvement like tinder. And bumble why not? for village people in Gujarat, India"
John Furlong,"The concept is fine and the app is pretty good when it works. However, the glitches are just too severe to be worth it. I have to restart the app every 3 swipes because it freezes on the loading screen otherwise. Periodically I've lost the ability to edit my bio at all for days at a time when the option just vanished from settings for literally no reason! The app also constantly crashes and is just generally a mess. If the developers fixed the bugs it would be 5 stars, but they've had 5 years and it somehow has only gotten worse. Use Tinder instead, at least the app works."
Kyle Evans,"It's okay. It seems like there are less fake accounts than there are on tinder, but I also get less matches. Could just be because I'm ugly though 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️"
Ty Hal,"Very good free app. Feels alot better than Tinder. I love how there are different categories of who you can meet-friends, lovers, or buisiness partners. It's brilliant."
A Google user,"Great features, gets things moving much easier than with tinder"
Chase Walling,Way better than Tinder. Introduced me to someone really awesome.
A Google user,"A huge improvement on tinder, this app makes browsing profiles quick and simple."
Artur,Just like Tinder. People are mostly on here to see how many matches they are getting. Just an ego game. not a dating app
HJ Blom,This app is unpolished (bugs) and unused. I live in a populated area yet I only received people living 40+ km away. Selection is also vastly smaller to tinder. A complete waste of time.
A Google user,Think men just think its tinder really
Martin Nikolaev,"Good app, better than tinder"
Will Thomas,"It speaks as if its a big platform used daily, but you really will be matched with like a person a day while it shows you have about 5 waiting lol. It purposely wastes your time to increase its app ranking with the illusion of possibly receiving sex, love, business, friendship, etc. Almost predatory for the lonely. It made me go back to Tinder. Edit: i always leave my mile search on 100, if by widening criteria you mean adding men to thebperspectuve im ok on that lol"
Richard,Your attempt at leveling the dating field has failed I have matched with so many people but I cant message them. How does that make sense to you? So after getting bored with that I tried to use your bff function which is filled with men who are sexually interested in other men. So lesson learned I guess dont try and make friends on a tinder type of app
Henri Lelsz,Certainly not as good as tinder
WWIII,"Awesome app let's the women pick you. Way better than the hassles of pof, tinder and all the other apps!"
Mike Midkiff,"Joined this app after I started a divorce. At first everything was fine, but I quickly noticed that not only could I get an exponentially larger amount of matches on tinder, but also a much larger amount of first dates. Come to think of it in my 6 to 10 months on bumble I didnt go on a single first date with a match from this app, and my profiles where identical. On top of that when I finally did find someone (on tinder) that I chose to pursue a serious relationship with I deleted my account with bumble. One would think when deleting your account that the app would stop charging your card.... NOPE. It charged me every week for over a month before I noticed it. When I contacted customer service for a refund they responded with ""it's in our terms and conditions"", and ""we cant automatically stop your subscription when you delete your account"". After emailing back multiple times to argue this a normal business would apologize for the inconvenience, and refund your money. NOT BUMBLE!!! They're customer service employees just kept responding with ""it's in out terms and conditions"" I've contacted my bank to dispute the charge. This app SUCKS!!!! Save your time, and save your money."
Jake Brown,Better than tinder
Johnathon Crippes,It's fun and easy to use. Way better than tinder
A Google user,Tinder is better
John Rambo,"I tried right swiping hundreds of women and still got zero matches. This is just like tinder, impossible to get a match."
Charles Barton-Cooper,Totally awesome app! I had Tinder before this and it kills Tinder! I had Tinder gold 6 months and not one date! First 24 hours on Bumble and I got myself a date.
A.,"The free side of it used to be good. Now you have to swipe hundreds and hundreds of profile before reaching the ones that have swiped you right comes up unless you pay. Being able to restrict to one year of age would be good: for example, 36 to 36 and also really restricting to one gender. The transgender community is already suffering a lot being antagonised. Having them show up in the feed of men only into women isn't great. These men might just laugh at their profile. To answer the developer comment below: I receive notifications telling me ""This bee likes you! Swipe now to see if it's a match"". On this notification I can see the face of the person. I tap on it, it opens Bumble and it takes me to swipe tons of people before I finally reach that profile. So far all profiles before the one who swiped yes on me are NOT a match --> conclusion: this proves that people who swiped yes on me are NOT put at the top of my queue (unless I pay an extra for that). I talked with a few of my friends that are transsexuals and transgenders (these terms are different). Instead of being paraded like ""circus freaks"" in front of sometimes not ""very open-minded"" (sarcastic tone here) straight males (who selected women and not transsexuals or transgender), they would at least like to have the CHOICE to swipe only men that are interested in them. I'm sure some men would like to pick only ""women"" as a choice as well. I understand that adding more options is a COST FOR YOU and allowing multiple choices is another one BUT please do not tell me that forcing a minority to the lion's den is about inclusivity. This is insulting. At least ""we're working on it"" is a more appropriate lie. On that note, let's say I'm 35 and I'd like to see profile of 33 years old as well but only the profile of the 33 years old who at least selected ""up to 35"" in their preferences in men. I don't care to swipe countless profiles of 33 years old who don't have their preference going up to my age as I won't even appear in their queue. I'm aware that like Tinder you might be against that since most of your money is made on creepy old men sending gifts/charms/other paid extras to 21 years old... Do I need to even comment on how wrong that is and how close that is to woman exploitation and prostitution?"
Vee Washington,Way better than tinder.
Henry Arsenault,"Not sure what the developers are doing. They seem to be taking steps to making their app more difficult to use. My first complaint is that you used to crop photos in your profile. This is now no longer available and photos have reverted to full size, even if you didn't intend the full photo to be seen. E.G. alcohol or ex-girlfriends. Secondly the option to edit the about me section seems to have vanished. I am now stuck with the bio I have and cannot change it. Overall it seems design decisions are going in the wrong direction. Users should be getting more choice not less. At this point the only really innovation it feels bumble is making are the females message first and 24 hr response time requirements. Otherwise if you compare Bumble to other dating apps it just kinda sucks. Shaking to backswipe is not a great system and feels like an unnecessarily complicated way to do so. The new design format does not significantly improve its functionality and now i have to crop and reupload my photos just to get my profile back to the way I had it. Compared to how tinder has innovated lately; daily pick swipes and four randomized ""super-like"" choices; Bumble feels stale and unwieldy. Matches are much rarer and theres much less incentive to continue swiping. To improve their app they need to bring freedom or at least the illusion of it back to the user."
matt beram,SCAM. The profiles are fake. They only want you to purchase coins. Tons of tech glitches and frequently crashea. Total waste of time. Tinder and POF are way better.
Alexander Mundy,Seems less toxic than Tinder
Mehar Kaila,"I like a lot of things about bumble, yes it doesn't work everytime (women still messaging just hi and waiting for you to start the convo), but it's loads better than Tinder."
Zachary Truskowski,"I like it a lot, more than tinder sinse the ladies talk first so it's not just a bunch or horny guys. BUT, I have to reopen the page to get new messages and a lot of connection errors."
M Grohl,"Way better than other dating apps. There is real people here, not just fake profiles as in Tinder. The app itself is smooth, well polished and easy to use. I just hope they keep it like this for long."
Ernest Crvich,"Thanks to the dev team for pointing out the new(ish?) granular notification options, hopefully that will help with the annoying ""rush hour!"" junk. I would still say that alerting me to people outside my search radius who have swiped right on me is rather pointless, since I won't see them if I open the app. The new profile scrolling is worse than the original, IMHO (you can't scroll anymore in full size pic view). Still better than Tinder though."
A Google user,Better than tinder
Jonny O'Connor,"Updated score from 1 to 3 as below problem was fixed. I will mark higher once I can set my location to a fixed place rather than it be roaming. I often travel for work and don't want to match with people from whatever area I am in at the time. Tinder offer this to its premium users with no issue. I really want to give this app better marks but.....I am unable to join Bumble Boost. I want to give these guys more money but the link on the app won't let me. As such, I have 50+ likes that are hidden behind a pay wall that I can't get through, despite trying. Change this and I will be happy to mark higher."
Tom McDonnell,"In my short time using Bumble I've found this app to be much better than Tinder or OkCupid. I think the requirement that women message first is an effective way to combat the shotgun approach that many men use on dating apps. On Bumble I don't have to compete with guys that spam every woman with hastily written approaches, and women don't have to sift through piles and piles of such messages, looking for someone genuine. The Bumble method means less work and more success for me."
John Whalen,"Images may or may not populate for users, many of which seem to be phantoms- in app purchases never seem to populate, until you prompt their customer service portal, who act as though you should just be stoked to be here. Meeting people in person, however busy you are works infinitely better, or of course there's Tinder which works like a champ🤷‍♂️ You'll get matches when you join, or when you travel- then you vanish into unseen space for newer users to be viewed- so that's 2 stars in fairness for early adopters or travel. Mostly worthless time passing if you stay in one place"
Anthony Pacello,Better than Tinder
Enjay Zee,Well written app. Good business model. Better than tinder.
Thomas Szucs,"A great premise and an intuitive interface, this beats Tinder by a mile if you're looking for something more than hookups. I prefer the way it used to look before the latest update though."
Laura Curtis,"I love the concept and generally find the guys are ""nicer"" on here than Tinder, both better looking and polite. However, some features of the app make it frustrating. The location at the bottom is annoying. Then if you pay a subscription you get to see who has liked you but you have to click on each individual one and match them. With Tinder it's easier where all your likes are in one place and can swipe on many. It also gives you people from waaaay outside your mile limit. It gave me people 22 miles away when my limit is 8! So the lack of ease of use knocked it down two stars (especially when it's so expensive to pay for)"
Fifa Legend,Fun to use app! Hoping this review will help get me more likes. I think Bumble is jealous of tinder and a good review will help my chances 😏
Theo,"Of all the apps I use, this one gives me the least amount of matches. Not sure why, but bumble does seem a tad bit more buggy at this point then Tinder. I think messages should also show ""read"" after a user reads them. I think this is a sorely needed feature. Otherwise bumble is ok."
A Google user,There are way more hot girls than tinder
A Google user,"Whenever I open the application on my phone, I receive a pop up saying that I need to upload an image when I have already uploaded six. I've tried deleting/recreating my account and uninstalling/reinstalling the app with zero luck. Tinder app works just fine on my phone."
Josh Graham,"While the new app design with scrolling similar to Instagram looks fancy, it's completely impractical for this type of app. Also you can't even read the bios now due to their horrible background color + font size & color choice. Find myself using Tinder more these days. They seem to understand why people use these apps and that's ease of use. Still find I get better dates using bumble though. Wish they'd get their UI act in gear"
Melissa Liston,Its turning out like tinder unfortunately
Riley chometa,"Can now add a profile picture but i must turn off my VPN sadly, even though tinder works perfectly fine with me using a VPN"
John Berg,"Decent app , better than tinder and 3fun for sure"
Itamar .P,Great app! In many ways better than tinder!
A Google user,"Better then tinder for sure, keep it free please"
Luke De Freyne,Its just so much better for guys than tinder. Girls actually reply and aren't just looking for casual hook ups. And having them make the first move is nice for a change 😂
Ben willoughby,Not very many people in my area use this app. Tinder is a much better app imo because of this.
Simon Nash,"Met a crazy psychopath, a hottie I liked and a girl much fatter than her photo. It's quite good and free. Hotties under 30 seem to match less than sexy cougars - they seem to just use it to get Instagram followers (or perish the thought they don't find me attractive lol) Better than Tinder as there are more women on there."
Julie Sheppard,Like that you get a little picture of someone who has liked you . Don't like the fake profiles but dont think that can be resolved & it is better than it is on Tinder
Bret Boatwright,Better than tinder. Not saying much.
RL Furse,women are stuck up compared to hotties on Tinder and Hi5

PASH PASH,Better than Tinder
Rhyannon Hayes,Swiping is the most unfulfilling waste of time ever. I start conversations with people that supposedly like me because we matched and then they either don't respond or don't bother asking me anything about myself so I have to carry the conversation like a fool. It's too bad I'm so sad and alone or else it might be easier to say f*** bumble and tinder but no. This is a horrible ineffective industry that feeds half off loneliness and half off horniness and it sucks.
A Google user,Great concept...but again...freemium just sucks...better experience on CMB and even Tinder than bumble
Duncan Ralph,"Bumble passes the first test of a dating app in that it has a large user base, but it's usability is pretty bad, and unfortunately has recently gotten worse. First complaint: photos are super high resolution, even if you don't full-screen them. This means bumble is essentially unusable unless you're on a firehose of a WiFi connection. There's tons of situations where, for instance, tinder is slow but chugging along ok, while bumble shows you ~five profiles twice through (that it clearly cached), then goes into an infinite loading screen. This has been an issue for several years. Second complaint: in the recent update (sep 2018 I think) bumble switched to a continuous scrolling model. Which would be ok, except it's made so that you can't swipe until it's perfectly stationary, which means if you want to see more than one photo before swiping, you start scrolling down, and the photos start moving (and continue with momentum) and then upon reaching a decision you have to carefully tap to get the photos to *stop* moving before you can swipe. Look, I obviously think it's a really useful app, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered with this wall of text. But these problems make it super annoying (and slow) to use at the moment, which means I'm spending way more time on the plentifully available alternatives."
Satya Morarji,"A bit scammy. Tells me I've currently got 9 matches and I have to pay premium to 'jump the queue' and see who they are. However, there's no one left to swipe in my area so either they are withholding matches until I pay, in which case there is no queue and they're lying... Or there are no matches in the first place and they are just lying to me to get me to go premium. I don't trust it and get way better matches from Tinder. UI is also laggy"
LeeVon White,"Better than the others. The primary reason is simply that women are required, and only women may make the first move in making contact. That simple rule is HUGE! No gross, unwelcomed, random contact from an unmanageable thousands of guys for even moderately attractive women. That fact alone should make it even more popular than tinder which provides only about half as much comfort in introduction. Women only get contacted by guys they have already decided might be a prospect for whom the feeling is also mutual as the men of course only have 24 hours to express that interest to keep them from being ""possibility collectors"". The concept is perfect. The execution leaves a bit to be desired though. I grant great leeway for the app's occasional bugi-ness. Bumble's main downside is the Tinder-esque lack of ability to refresh through the stack of those profiles potentially missed the first time you swept past them. Getting a small handful of like 2 to 5 new profiles to see per day after maxing out on the profiles one is allowed to see in their que (even for full paying members) is much worse than Tinder which makes it feel pretty useless after the initial encouragement one feels in the successful first couple of weeks when your profile is still in circulation. Given so many nefarious ploys used by software firms these days, I am left with the distinct suspicion that the initial success a user feels with Bumble followed by the sudden, inexplicable vanishing of about 95% of the profiles to review and 100% of connection frequency/interest is likely not an isolated experience for me. Rather, it is the result of a sophisticated formula designed to extract revenue in the duplicitous tradition of modern American business and advertising - especially in the tech industry. As potentially underhanded as they might be, however, Bumble is still the best option out there. Someday, if a dating app comes along that is able to find a clever way to reduce the problems of ""ghosting"", ""catfishing"" and also has an even marginally effective way to cupid together good compatible connections instead of disingenuously claiming that their 'computers' magically match potential couples, those developers will surely take over the world."
Jordan Sloan,Better than Tinder.
N L,"If you're not looking to sub, dont get this. Without a sub you cant really do anything except swipe. You'll get matched but you csnt view them to message anyone. Edit- as the reply states you can swip through queue to get matched. if you are not subbed you cannot see these matches thus cannot message them. they also delete matches that havent been contacted within 24 hours to keep things moving. so basically if you dont sub you swipe and match until someone who is subbed that can see your match. then they actually have to message first, which as a male never happens. its a ""free"" app in the sense that you dont have to pay to open it up and swipe on people in your area. basically without a sub its tinder with no clue who your actually matched to. with a sub there are many other options. if you dont want to pay monthly, this is a swipe game. nothing more."
Morgan Kralle,UPDATE: layout is better now than before but Android users don't get the profile badges which makes their profiles massively lacking. Quality of matches is about the same as Tinder. I prefer those with verified profiles but the majority of people don't talk or are only looking for hookups
SirGriZZerz90,Its better than tinder
Ryan Karg,Better than Tinder
A Google user,"The ladies (and guys) on Bumble are typically higher quality, usually established and have a career than on Tinder; let's keep it that way."
Mike Mezz,Better than tinder
Martin Taylor,"The UI is just so much garbage. It also doesn't help that I start hearing people talk about the new updates in my friend group and we compare and I'm somehow running an older version even after reinstalling. Not at all intuitive to use. Not conducive to forming lasting connections. And honestly most women just say ""hey"" so it's not like making women make the first move has actually improved the quality of the interaction. Probably fine for hookups but at that point Tinder has exponentially more users."
Jonathan Rodriguez,"Excellent app! I'm a male, and I've tried other dating apps, but this one has given me the most success. Lots of very decent women here. I would recommend this app to any guy who is looking for a serious relationship. If you just want to smash, get Tinder. That app is better for that purpose. If that's not your style, get this."
Sven Kasaroczky,"Not a hookup app like tinder, people here are actually looking for serious relationships. And ladies are required to message first, which is unique."
David Ellison,More matches than Tinder.
Ashton Collado,Much better compared to tinder. The girls feel genuine and aren't just there for Instagram followers. You can feel confident the girls who message you are genuinely interested. And the pool of women is out of this world. They're gorgeous.
Dale Nattrass,I'm not so sure about the look of the updated app but the concept and quality of this app in terms if the service it provides is fantastic (& much better than Tinder!!!)
Sang Lae Lee,"Best interface, better than tinder."
Optometrist,"It's just like Tinder with the swiping, but ladies make the first move by sending the first communication. I hate it, actually, cause even when you send a message, men just leave you unanswered. There needs to be a fiction that makes a message disappear after 24 hours like, you snooze, you lose, but it does what it's meant to do."
David J. Stevens,The boring version of Tinder.
Andrew Grimes,Just like tinder without the thots.
Altek,"Recently bumble changed their algorithm to match what tinder does, you can swipe till you're blue in the face with 25 potential matches waiting, you'll never find them unless you pay. Really good way to work on the human emotion of ""loneliness"" for your own self profit, you'll never get a dime from me."
Graeme Mole,"Good concept, bad execution. Matches disappear yet I get notifications about them. Potential matches, who I haven't matched with also disappear, since users can't remove their swipes its either fake accounts or Bumble is hiding them. Have potential matches waiting but run out of profiles to swipe. Everything this app does seems to push users towards paying. I've no issue paying if the app is worth it but I won't fund money hungry app developers who can't ever get the basics right. This app is nothing but a poor imitation of Tinder. Will be deleting."
A Google user,It's just a copy paste of Tinder
Rav Chaddha,"Decent app, better than tinder"
Rich,Tinder is way better it's free this app you have to pay to see who has liked you etc it's a waste of time!
A Google user,It's tinder but way better
Nick Desaulniers,Great concept bad results. I've been using this app for a couple of months and I've had over 10 matches. To where the girls don't even message me. I've had better luck on Tinder and Okcupid.
David Foote,Take clear pictures with your face well lit. No Snapchat filters. Cover friends faces with smiley. Be you. It's better than tinder. More active conversations and people my age!
Duke,"Not bad, pretty much Tinder with a couple other features (and less ""gimme money to make the app work""). Some functional issues, like message alerts not working when app is closed, or swiped profiles coming back to the cue immediately. Really like the concept of leaving it to women to initiate conversation; probably cuts down on a lot of unsolicited gross stuff for them, yeah?"
A Google user,"Given that 95% of the profiles are fake, are escorts, or are Instagram attention seekers, this app is clearly a complete waste of time. It's even worse than Tinder!"
John Goodrow,"The app is a graveyard, most of the accounts you swipe on appear to be inactive for months, if not years. Very few matches compared to other apps. Just stick to tinder if you're looking to meet people."
Alastair Knowles,"The idea is a good one, but the stuff that's out of the developers' control is kind of what makes it disappointing (the people who match with you usually don't communicate, or they send a ""Hi"" in the first 24hrs to keep you as an option to potentially communicate with later... not to actually communicate). The clock/deadline on communication should restart every 48hrs or something. Realistically, it's the exact same as tinder (with pretty much the same people), that allows women to control the initial communication...which has its upsides and downsides. If men accidentally swipe right they should be able to undo it in the first 30seconds or something... not sure if women are also unable to correct mistaken swipes?"
YKV YKV,Better than Tinder.
Jarrod Lu,I'd give 5 stars since I lost my virginity to a hot blonde chick with this app but the algorithm for matches is still messed up like tinder
J Frawley,"The app in itself is ok - it does what it says on the tin - but the functionality is terrible. Most of the time I have to close it completely and open it again to see new messages, it sometimes doesn't show matches in the queue until I close the app and open it again, and at least 50% of the time it freezes and I get the spinny yellow wheel on a blank screen, until I (you guessed it) close the app and open it again! C'mon developers, sort this stuff out until we all run back to tinder!!"
Naomi Amoo-Gottfried,"I like the app itself, but barely any of the guys have bothered to write anything about themselves. I'm not going to contact if you can't be bothered to write anything! Just a shame as the concept is good, but it seems like guys are treating it like another tinder"
Riley McGee,Better quality matches than tinder. Amazing customer service too.
Alex Kish,"This app definitely does what it says it does the job. It's not quite as fast or as aggressive as Tinder, (from a guy's perspective). Son comparing this app in relations to Tinder which I gave 5 stars. The one thing I like about the app over Tender Is the messaging system allows you to send pics and see if the other person has read your message, allowing for more organic pictures and conversation."
Tej Talks,Better than tinder
A Google user,It's like tinder only the girls have to hit you up first.
A Google user,"Like Tinder but people actually talk on it! Little bit buggy, notifications dont always come through and my match queue has been showing errors for some time. Overall great though."
Anna Glistvain,Really great concept and better experience compared to other apps like tinder.
Brian Bonyadi,Terrible app going back to tinder at least it shows me people in the area I choose.
A Google user,Better than Tinder!
Toby Skinner,"Like Tinder, but with slighty more convincing fake profiles."
Swarup Sahoo,"Works way better than Tinder. The only thing I didn't like is the lack of a feature that exists in the iOS version, where you can tap the phone number and it saves it in your contacts with a picture of the person and a bee emoji with the name. Please add this feature on Android too."
Luke,"Much better than Tinder. Meet more women consistently, as they're responsible for contacting YOU. Much slower swiping through people though. Not sure why they coded the swiping to be so much slower than Tinder. It's annoying. Overall I'm happy with Bumble."
alex franklin,Better than tinder and a lot less matches that dont respond
A Google user,"Waste of time...it takes to long to swipe, takes forever to gets matches, compared to tinder...bumble is just a money grab...useless in my opinion"
Caton Barrett,Only 1 match over like 2-3 weeks and they didn't even message me. I got over 5 matches on tinder in like 2 or 3 days. Why would I bother with this when there is clearly something wrong. There wouldn't be this many low reviews if it was as good as tinder.
David Moyer,"It is a ""swipe right for cuties"" app. Similar to hot or not and tinder. Except here if you both swipe right it is a match, and girls have to decide within 24 hours if they want to send the first message. Clientele here is a bit more classy and ""normal"" than most of Tinder, better for seeking dates rather than hookups, but as with any dating app you will still find about 30% of the ladies are bots seeking targets for spam and scams. Probably similar for the guys."
Nikki Chartier,"Maybe it's a regional issue, but even with 100 miles set, matches are limited and only about 5% even reply when messaged. I came to Bumble because people said it was more serious/better quality than Tinder but I disagree completely. Also bought a 1 week subscription only to find that 90% of those matches were 200+ miles away. Highly disappointed. I'll always recommend Tinder over Bumble."
paul rockinger,not a bad app. love the lack of fake profiles like on tinder and pof but still not finding who i want.
Daniel B,Much less activity than tinder. I get they want money but ask for money to enhance the experience. I've paid for quite a bit on tinder because I've had good experiences but wanted great. App is iffy too. Pics often don't load. And they won't let me choose which pic I have first saying it's not clearly of me. Unless my dog happens to be into dating apps it's pretty obvious who the pic is of!
Luc Limoges,"Meh, less bots than tinder and doesn't show me people from a different country so it ain't so bad"
Peter Seymour,I can't profess to being overly successful only a day into my experience but the concept of letting the ladies do the talking got my attention. The look and feel of the app comparatively to the likes of tinder and POF adds a refreshingly relaxed approach to dating.
Mike Paoli,It's ok tinder seems a bit better
A Google user,I like the concept but like tinder I never get any interests to me. If I do however at least I won't be scared to msg first@
IBFXM8 4,Better than tinder
mauricio chacon,"It works fine, it just doesnt work with my ugly, or iam probably just picky. But definitely more class than tinder"
Ray Mangione,Blows Tinder away. Women are more invested in the men they've swiped right knowing they're the ones to initiate. Less ghosting.
Lisa Berrie,Waaaaaay better than tinder and none of the sleazy vibe.
Chiana Sherwood,"I get matches and then the matches disappear or im having a conversation and then they dissapear too. Why would i pay for This BS app, it gets you nowhere. It for 24hrs said i had 399 matches..... there's not even that many single men in Auckland my age so that's BS and then i can't access them anyway. Im going back to Tinder. Which the same men are on anyway. Lol"
Sionis Heller,Many fake profiles. You get WAY more matches on Tinder. Women still won't message you after you match.
Gary Chartier,"Really crappy, even when compared with Tinder."
PWM,"I have had a great experience on Bumble compared to Tinder. The women on here are more likely to meet you upon matching after they send the first message. Far better then Tinder endless text conversations. Met a fantastic woman on here, so far so good!"
Nathaniel Cushing,Last patch made it work super slow and not load pics. Back to tinder...
Luis Gonzalez,Better then tinder
Outerspacetoshii,"it's really cool to meet people and to be completely honest, unlike tinder, not all people just want nudes and sex 😂"
Spense O,There seems to be more classy women on Bumble ...and bots are far more uncommon unlike Tinder (which is INFESTED with bots and fake profiles). There is a verification feature to make sure that you are real... It seems to be working to drastically reduce fake profiles. App used to not work on my Pixel version 7 up to 8.0.0.0. Works as it should on 8.0.0.1. ... *UPDATE 2/5/18 Bumble won't even let me log in after uninstalling it/clearing local data and cache. It tells me 'incorrect email address' when I try to connect through FB. There is no way to change this either. So its stuck and I can't use this app at all
Eric Schilling,Better than tinder
Rasheed Ahmad,"In the couple of days using the application I have found it to be like Tinder, but to less toxic and more welcoming to people trying to accomplish different task. I mainly use it for the Networking due to life being less about what you know but who you know."
Grzegorz Ch.,Match better than Tinder in my opinion :)
Anonymously Anonymous,"I love this app! I think it's a great platform to meet people and it's nice that the women can choose who they want to talk to, I think it's much better than tinder"
Joe Taz,Higher class clientele than Tinder
M,More quality than Tinder. Actually interested to meet. I have found what I was looking for.
Arianna .perez,"My only thing is that the notifications are horrible like I think they're too jumbled and you don't really realize what they're saying. Like I don't realize that someone sent me a message because it's combined with bee puns. Like in tinder it's very clear... ""Guys name"" - you have a message. Bumble - The hive is buzzing with new ppl and you got a new one. But I do like the bumble BFF version as well. I like the idea of being able to find friends you can vibe with without the struggles of everyday life."
John Cassidy,Good idea but 1 day is stupid short and anyone spendin money to keep it goin day after day is not smart and just wastin money - Tinder is better for this reason
A Google user,"Boooy oh boy, this app actually is pretty fun, much better than tinder to me"
Charlton Torbett,"Good app if you are looking for more of a relationship (as compared to tinder). Seems like they group the ""hot"" and ""not hot"" girls a little too much. I would get bored after a little while. I would (and have) recommended it to others."
Ek J,"This app is garbage compared to tinder. Firstly, there are a lot of fake profiles. More than I see on tinder. Also, there is a lot politics that seem to affect how the companies run and tries to get the userbase to forcefully accept it. Long story, this app is a waste of time."
Gabriel Arivett,"Bumble is a great dating app. Great for meeting new people or networking or finding new friends. in my opinion, Bumble is way better than Tinder. Bumble is a lot better than Tinder. I highly recommend using bumble for dating or meeting new faces. Highly recommend this app. Bumble is better than Tinder! Absolutely!"
Aris,"Used to be great, but now frozen. I have '2 likes' showing, but for 2 weeks straight I've been swiping with absolutely nothing changing. Still the same '2-likes' with no new matches. Apparently these 2-matches are at the end of infinity. Tinder & Hinge are going great though so whatever."
C.B,"This app is OK, and its extremely expensive. Considering it doesn't stick to the distance settings. It shows a few people nearby then will start showing people hundreds of km away. Its nice i guess that girls get a chance to make first move, but at the same time the match expires eventually which is krap. A month of this subscription costs nearly double of Tinder Gold. Not much benefit in it for me because , the match expires after a while, and the distance setting doesnt work the way it should . Will continue to use the free version, not worth paying for"
Raluca Nechita,"The app uses the same principle as Tinder only that girls need to take initiative and message first. Good idea but not working. Seems nobody is replying, the app is crashing all the time, I can't get any notifications if I get a new message or match unless I open the app itself. All in all seems Tinder is better."
cosmicmelon,"Buggy, dodgy, wants to be Tinder so bad. Why would anyone want to be like Tinder? Do not waste your time with either. Watching paint dry is far more exciting."
Michael Denison,"Honestly I think it's a better, safer version of tinder for women. Also like that you can swipe unlimited a day, the back track feature is cool too. As a single guy using these apps, I think about the fact women get bombarded on these apps compared to a guy. I like that the woman has to initiate the conversation, makes me feel like I'm not bombarding someone."
A Google user,Giros write first so it's a bit better than Tinder
nicholas lim,"Good concept, ok execution, but results are absolutely terrible. It's like Tinder, but Females go first. Which seems like a good idea, until you realise they will never ever go first. So yea, if you use this app, swipe everyone right. Lower your standards. Lol i know it sounds insulting to say ""standards"", but it is the point of dating apps right?"
thatprettydarkgirl 1994,"Best dating app ever and you're talking to real people, better then tinder and okcupid tbh"
A Google user,I like the format better than tinder. This is the only online dating platform that has ever scored me a date.
Rishabh Jain,"Amazing dating app. The girls are so much better than tinder. Hahha, excuse the language. Found my lasting relationship from this place"
David Stiles,"Bumble is like Tinder that uses Instagram. So naturally it is full of the same sort of people as Instagram. Lots of people with very crafted photos, people who value their appearance in ways that most people do not. Bumble's free membership, like most dating apps, removes your ability to communicate or even see who ""matched"" you. And the membership is very expensive compared to competitors. Positives: Women make the first move. But males can still choose to ""Match."" Also, it has a professional networking side that seeks to sort of combine Tinder and Instagram and LinkedIn. There is also a Friends mode. Conclusion: Mostly, a waste of time, unless you are the type of person who is obsessed with Instagram and you want to date similar people, and you're willing to shell out plenty of cash."
Nick Tavares,"Pros: Less spam, more genuine people Cons: You can only swipe within your current location (can't adjust it to another city), match time expiration is short (24 hrs isn't enough time), ""superswipes"" and boosts aren't free (At least on Tinder ""super likes"" and boosts reload after awhile) Personal experience: I have had zero success with Bumble. Tinder has been successful at least giving me matches and dates."
Zane Elliott,"Definitely better than Tinder, still rather ineffective though. A big change I believe all the dating apps need is a more personalized location setting (ie, I live at X and work at Y, so if I swipe and keep my range ~30mi ish I see people all over and the location range is actually crazy). Should also ONLY show people in our location range looking within the same range. Just some quality of life upgrades and this all will be the best dating app"
Noah Shindler,Do NOT pay for bumble premium. It is awful. It has no distance restrictions and shows you people way out side your range. I had 2 layovers and did not use bumble at all..then i get home and everyone i like is 100 miles from the city i had a layover in. So i paid for bumble boost to like 50+ people who are 2000 kiles away?? I emailed bumble and they would not refund me for the 3 months. Use hinge or tinder!

Devonte Gilliam,"It's getting better, the most of the women here are more beautiful than what tinder has."
Addison Weber,It's just tinder but the girls talk first.. You don't get any free super likes which kind of stinks. But there's free rewinds. Took a star off because you have swipe and I prefer the buttons like tinder. I've misswiped a few times trying to swipe through pictures.
A Google user,Has a good premise but the girls are even flakier than on Tinder (I actually noticed a difference). Additionally I think they stuff the app woth fake 'generic model' profiles. I wish you luck using it but I never had any.
Ashley Tomas,"There's no regulating going on, the pitch is that this app is supposed to be a female friendly space but I still get disrespectful messages. Men insulting my appearance then asking for sex. I feel dirty and mistreated after using this app. Tinder had more honest men available :/"
A Google user,Bumble has better looking girls than Tinder but Bumble swipes really slowly and takes a long time to load new girls
B Peoples,It was stuck on full screen mode...so I couldn't even make a profile. Not exaggerating I just downloaded tinder bc maybe that one will actually work.
Jon M,"Compared to tinder this app is quality over quantity. As a guy this app seems to link me with more women who actually have bios and are looking for relationships. However matches are less frequent but tend to be more likely to turn into a conversation. With that said the messaging part of the app sucks. It often fails to notify me. Additionally if someone likes you, you have 24-48 houses to speak with them or it automatically unmatches you. Not good when many times the app fails to inform me of a match or conversation. Also the distance setting will randomly change to over 70 miles without me knowing."

I imagine women like that their messages aren't bombarded by douche bags and therefore enjoy this app more. The only change I'd like to see, is more than 24-48 hrs before matches expire."
Cierra Belsan,Oddly enough it makes me really downgrade myself and honestly hate dating. Yet I still think highly of myself. I get tons of matches but when ever I get a response it's one word and never stays. Either this app has some major glitches or the men are really inconsiderate. Opposite of tinder though more and more guys are actually doing that too.
Andre Erbele,Bumble is the slowest amd least responsive of all the dating apps. Its expensive and doesnt offer much. Its focused on looks (just like Tinder) and does not allow more than 300 character bio for you to describe yourself in. Its a joke of an app.

Flannigan Bluffs,"Requires Facebook. I closed my FB account due to security concerns. There are so, so many way to verify that someone is a bot or not that don't included Facebook. It's a shame this is the only option. At least with Tinder you can verify with your phone. Get with the modern times, Bumble."
Vick Tikoo,"Bumble has become a scam, bigger than Tinder. Initially you will get a few matches and then suddenly it becomes a desert, of course unless you pay! Early this morning I had over 50 coins, a few of which I used and afternoon, there were no coins. I am convinced these apps are only hooking you in to pay, not to match you! If their algorithms matched you religiously, they wouldn't have a revenue stream."
Chris Radomile,"The app and interface itself is fine, but if you want to check out other photos besides the main one, it often takes 4 or 5 seconds for each photo to load, even on a fast WiFi connection (meaning it could take up to a minute to see all the photos). The  first photo always loads quickly and I don't have this problem with Tinder on the same Internet connection, so I'm not sure what the issue would be if not the app itself."
DrQuantum Bunneh,I have been using this app for about a month and I have yet to get a response. I bet all of these profiles are fake and it is just another Tinder or any other dating service.

Cassidy Mixon,Not that bad... Just feels a little too cluttered and I'm personally not a fan of messaging first..or the time limit. I prefer Tinder.
Grimdrome,I can confirm it loads lots of dead accounts. I've met people on tinder that I saw on here and they all stopped using their accounts months to a year ago. Great idea but not removing old accounts is just them trying to make themselves look like they have a big user base
A Google user,"Great idea ruined by greed.  Pretty much tinder but twice as expensive.  You pay for likes and the app keeps feeding you the same people over and over to waste your money if you forget who u superliked and who u didn't.  Doesn't matter if you like or dislike, you will see the same people every day.    And forget about the filters,  want someone close by?  Nope.  filter doesn't work at all, locations are lies, ages are lies,  this whole app is a joke.   In response:  I am fully aware that the app itself is free, but you can pay for superlikes, which are a ripoff and ruined by greed because as I said earlier, user locations are lies, and you keep getting the same matches over and over...   Spending money and likes on the same people over and over if you don't catch that its the same person just with a different pic.  Once you super like someone it should show that you already have and warn you before doing it again.  Like i said...  Greed."
ThroughHorizons,"Full of fake profiles, requires Facebook, all-around terrible app. Use something else like Tinder."
tritanproductions,"Never get matches from this app, I get like 1 every couple weeks and I swipe A Lot of people seems kind of odd since I get some matches on tinder."
Michelle Briffault,So much better than tinder and badoo. Hardly any bogans 😅
Kevin Walton,I can't get a single match! I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Used the same profile on Tinder and I don't have any problems matching up. I've been hopelessly swiping right on Bumble for weeks and cant seem to match with anyone.
Cesar Ayala,"Good concept a ""female friendly tinder"" but for some reason it doesn't work. There are countless inactive accounts. And when you connect, the woman doesn't start talking at all, meaning you end ghosted. Even the 24 hours extension won't change that. The level of ghosting is brutal. Luckily the premium options are so bad that you don't feel compelled to spend any money. Seems the company say they have around 30 million active users. Hard to believe, because the Android version has 5 million downloads, so to have that amount of users active... The iPhone version should have.... 50 million downloads in total?"
Sean Barker,It's a sexiest app that relies on a man's loneliness as leverage to extort money from him. Save yourself the trouble and use tinder or go one better and just say hi to a woman in the street or on the bus.
David Humphrey,"A fine idea with competently-executed software and a few puzzling design decisions (that tight profile character limit...ouch), but it's functionally identical to Tinder if you're ugly, which makes it no use to me."
Dalton Kiser,Super awesome simple and easy about the same as tinder but I like the girls first thing made a few matches got one taker not to shabby
ruan coetzee,Swiped right to everyone until there was no one left to swipe... Feels like the app steals profiles from everywhere... I get more matches kn a week to week basis on tinder than on this thing... Aee there even active users?
Jeremy Hutchings,"Firstly it's stuffed full of fake profiles, secondly the CEO who split from Tinder to do this obviously doesn't understand that women rarely make the first - if any - move in dating. Online or not. The concept of ""giving power back to women"" and eliminating ghosting is laughable as they had it all along, and are the main culprits of ghosting. Sad times we live in ...Tinder is balanced as people there are equal ..... bumble is a joke"
Anthony Eccles,"After paying app still doesn't show me the matches, still blurred. Contacted Bumble and the issue still persists and matches expire in 24 hrs..better off with Tinder at least that app is functional."
Okami,"100% better than tinder, but just like tinder the message section doesn't like to auto update, and unlike tinder you can't prompt it to update the message section."
Tyler M,"Horrible. 90% of people on here aren't aren't even real. Not having an option to change location was annoying as well. Don't recommend, just get tinder."
Mike,"Did not generate many connections, and when I did, the women often did not initiate the conversation.  Got bored and downloaded tinder,  have gone on half a dozen dates so far from tinder.  Came back to check out bumble again and I see they are not allowing any pictures with guns.  I own guns whether or not my dates know it before hand.  Seems counterintuitive and a waste of my time and any woman's time who hates being around guns.  She's gonna have to find out eventually.  They said they want to make everyone feel safe.  If someone doesn't feel safe around guns, how is it going to make them feel safer not knowing beforehand whether the person they are meeting owns guns? #virtuesignaling"
Patrick McDonald,"Stigmatizes gun owners, hunters, police officers, and military members. Just use tinder"
A Google user,"This app is worse than tinder, and I didn't think that was possible; there's wayyy too many fake profiles. The consensus I'm gathering after having used all the popular dating apps is that online dating just doesn't work. Everyone is superficial, materialistic and facetious. There's no individuality, because everyone says the same stuff."
A Castrilli,Bumble works NEITHER in the favor of women nor men.  I think the goals of the app are noble ones but this notion of a 24-hour time slot work in favor of  nobody involved. I have more expired or missed connections due to not opening the application in over 24-hours than necessary.  The app is so uninteresting that I might be urged to check it less seldom that I already do.  Bumble wants your money so you might have a slightly more worthwhile experience by having the power to re-match or override the lady's permission for you to write before mutual acceptance.  STAY ON TINDER and unfriend all the jerks like you have been up until now.
Trap-Tech On Fresh-Droid TV,People on this app are more serious about relationships instead of sex and going on dates all the time. I love it. I love that women have to lead. Also I don't like the swipe up and down on pictures though. But everything here beats Tinder by miles. Tinder is just garbage town with horrible quality of users.
Nubian Princess,"I don't have Facebook, therefore I can't use this app. At least Tinder upped their game with the login. So stupid"
alex ballesteros,"Tried using this app a few times and it's a complete waste of time. See what happens when feminists try and develop a dating app, rubbish gets put out. Women complain men don't approach them in person, or only the rubbish ones do, well when you prevent a man starting a conversation you get this hot garbage. I have the exact same profile as i do on tinder and lucky if I'll get 1/10th of the matches.   Don't waste your time here, tinder is wayyyyy better and you can actually start a conversation, as well as the calibre of the women is much higher (and less fake profiles!)"
Sean K Hoyle,"App is great, better than tinder and the women seem to follow through on here."
Jan Gerrit Klok,"I actually worked in social media myself and if I wanted to keep perfect matches from ever speaking to each other, I'm not sure how better to execute it. Theoretically it's possible to meet someone special through Bumble but shockingly Tinder does it better. And I'm not talking hook ups, actual relationships.   Women on Bumble seem to swipe right much less often. Or let a rare match just whither away as they expire in 24h. WHY would anyone pay for an app that makes it HARDER to get in touch? Get women to actually be less passive online! That's half of the cause for gender imbalance in dating.   While the idea to let women do the partner shopping is great, there are additional limitations. Why all the extra actions for a guy to get a passive match ""extended""? Women in online dating act passively enough as they are, do we need more hurdles to jump over before acknowledging a guy online? Women need to in my opinion not only get the initiative, but also learn that shopping for men is like shopping for a dress that needs to suit all occasions. Try a few before you buy."
A Google user,"I'll never bother with Tinder again. Bumble seems to have a better class of women, and the idea to have women initiate contact after a match was a great one."
Zachary Tresnak,Definitely better than tinder.
Jacob Cohen,Better than Tinder
Mark E,A step up class wise from tinder and POF etc. its nice that the women have to make first contact so it adds a bit of a threshold of interest on their part. plus the caliber is higher.
Chad Massaker,This app is far far better than other dating apps like Tinder. Whatever their formula is it works in terms of finding higher caliber women today for the most part. Far less sugar babies on here looking for sugar daddies which is good for me. I don't particularly get into the whole hooker with a different payment arrangement plan.
candice cash,Better than tinder 😛
A Google user,"Bumble is sexist. It's very initiaive to empower women disenfranchises the power of normal men to pursue women . With that said the idea is nice, guys are empowered by social media to say or do or channel whichever sexual deviant behavior they want but to be honest human nature. Let's just talk subjectively, metrics. Bumble has yielded me no results. Other hand tinder and okcupid has systematically yielded more dates and even long term girlfriends. On top of that, bumble uses thier corporate model to throw identity politics at tinder/match group to identify with women identitytheft politics. After using more successful platforms I will now swipe left on bumble and use more effective, commerce encouraging and gender equality platforms like tinder and okcupid. Thank you."
Rodney Paa,"The layout is better than Tinder, it's smoother on my brain. Tinder is a headache. Tinder is full of fake accounts that will lead you to a site where you pay. Bumble is all real girls so far."
A Google user,"Uninstalling because of frequent political editorial content. I happen not to agree with their politics (for example, they praised the LA Clippers, a racist organization who doesn't want black people to attend games, and most of their politics are misandrist, feminist hypocrisy), but would still disapprove of the spam even if I agree.  Glad they have an option not to show push notifications. They're mostly annoying and useless. But then you don't see notices of new matches and new messages. Have to log in blindly and randomly to see if anything new occurred, a scenario I prefer to seeing the useless stuff.  I much prefer the user demographics on Tinder. Almost all women on Bumble in my area are white, liberal, upper class. Tinder has much better diversity. I almost never see a black or Asian profile on Bumble, nor a white working class one. Tinder and POF reflect the diversity in my area and aren't limited to rich ""professionals"".  If you like rich white women, OK Cupid (owned by the same superior people as Tinder and POF) has similar demographics to this site.  Photos here seem to use more bandwidth than on Tinder.  Most women expect the man to lead, so the main concept here is limiting to both genders.  Recently Bumble spammed libel about Tinder to my email account.  As to their ban on gun photos, I consider guns a dealbreaker and used to swipe no if a woman had a gun in her photo (because women are exempt from the draft. Typical feminists never seek actual equality). Now the people who dislike gun lunatics cannot weed out undesirable matches.  Some of the same people reappear every few weeks.  Goodbye!"
Matt Maux,It sucks... literally an exact duplicate of Tinder (which also sucks). Only worse.
Brett Wallace,SJW app that stole from tinder. Their way of fighting sexism is to give women special privledges. Disgusting image of our future. I'm gay btw so don't blame me for using women.
Christopher Tavarez,"I thought at first this app would be awsome but then shortly figured out girls never like to message first. Idk if they know thats how this app works and they are supposed to message first, but literly out of the 30 matches i got within a week or 2 not one messaged me at all. Soo i guess ill just stick to POF and Tinder where a conversation  can actually get done."
Matt O'Connor,"This app is certainly a nice change from tinder, I'm finding less fake profiles and it's good to know that the women you are interested in make the first approach. This saves a lot of time."
Barrie Mclelland,"A Tinder like app, but puts the responsibilities of the 1st message onto the lady. The location and distance options are very flawed, and definitely needs to be fixed in the next update."
Steven Driskill,"Eh waste of time. Had it for a week got one match, been on tinder for one night and I've gotten 30 likes and 5 matches.  I put two stars because I see its potential but its got a long way to go."
Nana O.,"All the dudes from tinder found out about bumble, and once again, this platform has turned into a hookup site and not an actual dating site, as bumble falsely advertises. Just skip it ladies. These are the same trashy dudes, with the same trashy expectations who are NOT looking to date you. Some gross dude I never even said two words to randomly sent a photo of his penis on here and bumble did nothing to prevent that eye rape."
Phillip Dudley,The app itself is great and intuitive. However a lot of the women's profiles seem like they were copied out of Tinder or they say that the man must message first. That isn't the point of this app.
Monique Elwell,Bumble is Tinder for people with jobs.
tony l,I've done tinder a year this is much better.I always get messaged and plenty of people in my city.You get to swipe for free as many women as the app can find and also its great that it filters the women who want to pursue me . it is an indicator they have a good level of interest and the 24 hour time limit helps motivate a fast response I know I'm a priority.
Noah DCTN,"Doesnt work for me. Ive used it off and on for a year and a half and ive never had a date though bumble, not even a decent conversation. Matches rarely message first. Ive had much more success with tinder, which is too bad a descent alternative would have been nice"
SumDude,"THIS APP SUCKS!! Good luck getting matched with a decent looking girl, that isn't a bot or online prostitute. Only fatties and uggo's. You would probably be better of with Tinder, or anything else."
Kyle Palmer,"Never worked, way more response on Tinder.  The new ban on gun pictures is pretty stupid as well.  I personally take a greater interest in women that hunt or target shoot as it's a common interest.  Seems like an app for a bunch of snowflakes to push their agenda on everyone else."
Jake Pryce-Jones,"It's just a copy of Tinder. The only difference is that women have to message first, but the only women who message first are spam accounts."
Alexander March,"It's a wanna be tinder, that is less user friendly. The worst part is the developers force their political views on you. Bumble just started an anti-gun agenda that is being pushed onto all users. Maybe this app would be better if there was no politically motivated propaganda. I would give it 0 stars if I could."
Austin Phillips,"People are on this less than tinder, women generally ""initiate"" conversation with ""hey"" so its pretty much the same as tinder with less people."
David Kelly,"This so called free app is Not free , might as well be on tinder"
George Moussi,"Pics take too long to load compared to tinder, solid app otherwise  Edit: Pics loading issue fixed, now i love the app!"
Vinnie Paul,Photos take forever to load but it's not my connection. Tinder photos load perfectly and quickly.
Matthew,"I match pretty well with tinder and other apps alike.  I've had bookoo for months now with little to no matches. I've had a few female friends and I sat down and find eachother and we both swiped right to match but we never did. Very strange to me. Tinder I get matches everyday, Same with hot or not and lovoo. Bookoo for some reason, I've had maybe 5? Seems as if you have to pay to get matches."
Cory,"The 24 hours to make a connection is very unrealistic considering the fact that most people sleep for 8 hours and  work another 8 hours so realistically you only get 8 hours to make a connection if it's your day off. Additionally as someone who comes from hunting family, and is looking for someone with the same type of background; the fact that you no longer allow firearms in your profile pictures is ridiculous, but you can have marijuana pictures, almost nude pictures, and catfishers around every corner you might want to figure out the priorities and not your politics. It's not smart to alienate a group of people. Not only did I deactivate my account but about 20 other people I know did as well and have now filtered out to different web sites from FarmersOnly to Tinder. after reviewing your reviews I can see I'm not the only person who feels like this as well."
jake bringard,It's pretty much a poorly made knockoff of tinder. So many bots and bugs. I'm deleting it before my phone gets Ebola.
Benjamin Peterson,This company banning photos of guns was a terrible move. They have completely lost my support. Tinder doesnt do stupid stuff like this.
William Kinley,"Let me say why I gave this one star. I didn't have a problem with the app until I came across an ad from bumble that is banning guns in pictures as making users feel unsafe. Isn't the users ability to swipe right or left their decision? Why ban pictures of users in a hobby the enjoy and are participating legally? Why imply that gun owners are violent? It is the other person's choice to swipe and match with the person based on their pictures. Would they swipe right if they felt unsafe? For bumble's stance and advertisement, I will be uninstalling the app and will stick to tinder."
Michael M.,"Tinder is more efficient, women suck at initiating. Banning gun photos was the tip of the iceberg it's just not good to start."
Lucy Ballou,"I work two jobs, I pay for premium. I don't have time to spending on selecting yes or no to every person that liked me. Tinder is so much better on that part, I don't need to click on the profile.   Please make it easier to swipe and to deny as well as like profiles, especially the ones that already liked me.   It's confusing sometimes with the ones that are already matched.  The matches are much better, it just takes too long to get to good matches."
Dennis Drogo,It's easier and cleaner than tinder. . but thats it.
Alex Lower,"More fun to swipe through than Tinder and the ""ladies first"" policy is refreshing."
Tanner Bowen,Are you a guy? Do you like matching with people without trying to wow some girl with the first words that come out of your mouth? Then go back to Tinder!
Max Cruz,"The pool of attractive females that are not spam is good. When matched, females almost never make the first interaction and the match is lost. I don't see the point in even matching someone when there is not going to be any initial conversation on the females end. Especially when that is an advertised feature. There needs to be some way to remind ladies that they are losing a match due to their shyness. Tinder might be better if you are actually trying to talk to someone."
grady cunningham,"So people can show themselves doing drugs that may or may not be legal, and it's perfectly fine, but if we have a picture of our constitutional right we get kicked off with a note saying we may be a harm to other people? You left wing losers need to open your eyes. It's a piss poor app anyway. Get tinder. People actually reply to you. I hope this company gets sued. That is complete bs, and ignorant to take actions like this. It's not helping any cause, and so far I've only seen negative effects about it."
Rasta Loves,"Deleting my review is not cool ""Ex Tinder developers"" It's no wonder the cost is atrocious and the swipe option is ridiculous. Even users in the app mention this. You really need to modify the cost. Notice your rating is falling apart. As an app developer myself. One should consider a 3 day trail, just to show the benefits of even using Bumble. Yes! it's Fumble, why is that terrible? It's the Truth, and we have the right to know and acknowledge what we're paying for. Would you purchase a house without doors? How can you see how it looks on the inside. Looking through the window is not shopping unless a purchase is made. Samething with everything else in the world. Thank you."
L. Fletcher,App very laggy and matches just dissappear. Stick to Tinder!
trevor contreras,No one talks and they ban anything with a firearm with it. Worse than tinder
A Google user,Not worth dealing with the self important virtue signaling. Having a platform to make political statements is more important to them than maintaining a working app. Just download Tinder or Hinge.
Bobby Abrams,"Bumble decided to get political and ban photos of people with guns, bad move, bad for business, will hurt the app. Bumble should worry about Tinder being better not about politics"
Trevor Stempky,Apparently it only takes a picture of a gun to trigger the Bumble creators. Just use Tinder instead.
mike Johnson,This app is a joke! Better off using tinder!
Zack,"It's an okay dating app, I think it's only strong point was its UI. Recently they took a stance against lawful gun owners, making them out to sound like criminals. Will not be using again, POF and Tinder are better anyway."
Alec,"Don't download if you're busy. Don't download if you're a man  This app is anti free speech and expression, banning people from having pictures of themselves with weapons, for example in a shooting range, doing what they find enjoyable and fun regardless of political affiliation is prohibition of freedom of expression and speech.  When you get a match, it's on a timer, and if you're busy then oh well you'll have to pay to get them back.  This app also doesn't allow the male to send a message to a female.  This is dumb, but probably the only reason it was made so you can't really fault it for that, but regardless it is stupid because most of the time men are expected to message first.  This was made by an ex Tinder employee and is like a sort of less corrupt but not really Tinder except now it's even worse.  Don't download this garbage."
Shannon Hepburn,"Unlimited swipes,  girls message first. saves time of they're not interested but just swiping for fun. I think it's better than tinder."
Jay Lesley,It's different the problem is making a genuine connection. Surprisingly I think Tinder worked better. Refreshing dating app for the most part!
emma gorman,I met my current boyfriend on bumble and we're together nearly a year :) I love that the app was created by women. It's like a less creepy version of tinder and most of the guys I talked to all seemed serious about getting into a relationship. I don't use it anymore but I really enjoyed it!
Riley Mist,"As an app everything works great. People often don't answer but that's not the apps fault. I like it, it feels a lot safer than tinder."
Kuolettava !,Keeps freezing up and runs incredibly slow.  Imagine Tinder if it ran slow for some reason and half the profiles were abandoned or fake.
Curtis Grant,Totally stupid that women have to speak first... No one speaks first so ill match with someone. And it disappears. Ill rather just use tinder tbh
David R. Cole II,"Really great app.. Love the limitless potential. Only wish there was a way to grab a coin or two without actually paying for it somehow.. Either way, i recommend this over Tinder right now."
Jesse Townsend,"Great in theory but a failure in execution. Most boring selection of people I've ever seen. Most of them don't even write in their bios. Might as well stick with Tinder because this just basically a lesser version of it, regardless what it advertises. Also, it doesn't save my distance or age settings so I'm getting people from age ranges I don't want who live way too far."
James Gore,Better than Tinder although less of a user base
Elijaah,Honestly better then tinder
Derick torre,Very clever app......friends part is weak.....but I gotta say good quality women and better looking then the ones you find in Tinder. Either way Ive experienced lots of great times with women because of this app so great job Bumble
Jesse James,Classier version of Tinder
Ethan Conrad,Have used both this and Tinder. On Tinder after 5 months or so I'm just shy of 300 matches. In the same time I'm on 0 still on Bumble. I haven't got a single match. Really don't understand as I use the same pics and everything. Would never recommend this to anyone
Andrew Nutbourne,Almost all hook ups. Basically it's Tinder: nothing unique about it.
Philip Pettet,The idea of the is good ive 3 months with the booster wasted money on coins. The time in the booster no matches(I used it regularly)..super likes didnt get any matches. And most of the girls are fake supermodels.. there is not opportunity for your average Joe. When you finally get a match they dont message you. My three months using i got 2 matches 0 messages and 0 dates. Tinder isn't much better but at least I get matches with real people and get dates.
Robert Stephens,Haven't been lucky but definitely as good as tinder
Deanna,"Works way better than tinder and seems to have better quality people. I wish people had more than 1 day to respond,i get that they want you to stop using the free version and use the paid one but come on."
Marcus Beard,Better than Tinder!
Snake Attack,"When I swipe on tinder, Badoo, okc, POF, literally any other site, I see a realistic mix of attractive, unattractive, and average looking women. When I swipe on bumble, 3 out of 4 women are super model level drop-dead gorgeous. That's red flag number one. Number two is that I've been swiping on Bumble for a year and a half and I've made FOUR matches, one of which was someone I already knew. Compared to the hundreds of tinder matches I've made in the same time with the same profile, something just isn't right with Bumble."
A Google user,"What a worthless app just like in the real world the man has to do the first approach or nothing will happen i have had way more conversations from tinder of all things and that just started from a simple ""Hello"""
Nick Pitrone,Way better than tinder lol
Ricecube,little better than tinder but not by much
Savio Pereira,It's got all the Tinder girls
Bede Wolfenden,Like the app. People swem to be more responsive. Wish it could load peoples photos quicker. Tinder manages loading in a split second where bumble seems to struggle. Maybe use lower res photos?
Austen Paxton,Way better than Tinder. They dont have nearly as many fake profiles
Travis Anderson,More classy than Tinder. Too bad when you match the girl has to message you first. I've lost matches because they don't message first. There's also plenty of fake profiles. Inactive profiles should be disabled or removed from public view after a certain amount of time so our time isn't wasted swiping people not looking for a relationship.
Mason Rued,"Why did I verify? To avoid spammers. I see heaps of unverified accounts.what is the point of a verification process if you don't apply it to all? This app, much like tinder is chock full of inactive or fake profiles. Make it reverify every once in a while or make logging in give you a boost over people who haven't in 2 weeks."
Freya Eschle-Retallick,"Nice premise, very slow and bugs out alot though :( better than tinder but you cant set a location really so get alot of randomers"
Lindsay Woolward,Sooooo many straight people. Many of them homophobic. Never had these issues with tinder.
helio carbone,No body matched me back and when they do no body text you but so far it seems much genuine and real than Tinder
Dylan M,Much better than tinder
A Google user,"Works great, so much better than tinder, especially since now tinder slows your matches unless you pay to upgrade."
Jennifer Lentz,"Bumble certainly has a better selection of men than other apps, but 300 characters is way too short for a profile, and the app uses a ton of data (even with wifi on the the limit background data box checked).   Since starting to use bumble ive exceeded my data limit every month, i never used to turn on my wifi, but now its always on and the app is still using more data (GBs/month) than any other app.  I dont understand why it uses so much, seeing as how i dont post or send pics, and it basically has the same functions as okc or tinder and those use hardly any data. Hopefully ill be able to meet someone soon because I wont be able to afford the data overages for much longer."
Invin,"It shows you a huge number of fake impossibly good profiles and then suddenly you get the real ones, which are terrible. I've had far better luck with Tinder."
stuart oid,Its just a another clone of tinder. So unless your very handsome dont bother getting this app.
Kramer nineoneone,Worst app I have used. Have had it installed for like 2 years straight and get no matches at all. Atleast on tinder I can get a handful of matches a month. Though they tend to be fat girls.
DoomDog101,It's good but having to pay to see who likes you or buy at least one super like is not cool at least tinder gives you one free but other than that it's a good app
A Google user,"So your match expires once you. Find out you have a match, no clue who they are... At least tinder doesn't expire. My experience has expired with this bootleg tinder."
Ben Betts,Hardly any matches compared to tinder. Just feels like no one uses it
Kalli Francis,Ok so I never post reviews but this is an amazing app. Very intelligently designed. This is a smart app. I've used Tinder but this is my new favorite. Well worth the money (which I never thought I'd actually say)
Darren Bolognese,"They told me I had matched but I had to pay to see them, once I did they all suddenly disappeared, just get Tinder."
Jonathan Nilsson,"Not that popular as Tinder, which means eventually you will match with people 100km away."
Carl Kirby,"It's alright, no bots like tinder, the only reason I give 3 stars is most women don't realize they have to speak first, for about every 60 matches, maybe one or two actually realize they have to talk first"
Sam Parkinson,"Been using this for just over 2 months.   I get the concept and its great, in theory, however when you have to relie 50% of the people who use it to use it properly its never going to work.   I know woman who use it and can get 5-6 matches a day and get to pick and choose. 2 months and I have had 1 match who has spoken to me....still know date though.  Maybe I am undesirable and others have better experiences. But apps like tinder at least make it a level playing field to start and you can atleast make your own fate, as bad or as good as it is you have the choice and its in your hands just as much as it is theirs.   Only pro is less fake profiles than tinder."
S,"Slightly better than tinder, but misses the fun of shared interests."
EmJai Taylor,"It's better than tinder, it just takes some patiences. Women have to say something first, and a lot of times they don't remember to..."
Cooper Taylor,"Great app, better quality than tinder"
Austin Rheault-Koropatkin,"I've used this app for a long time now, and I will admit it was pretty rough at the start. But now there is a lot more people using it. No more bots and a very classy crowd of users. Better than Tinder."
Ori H,"Love the concept and would really like to give this service a go, but the facebook only requirement keeps me out. I do not want to be forced to join facebook just to be eligible to be among your users. Even tinder, who was limited to facebook account holders only, caved in eventually and allowed joining with just a phone number. Not all of us use facebook! It should not be synonymous with a digital passport of sorts nor is it the only way to authenticate a person's identity and avoid spam and bots."
Dean Aitken,"Great app! Had heaps of matches and dates and for once the ladies have to do the thinking on the 1st msg lol. Highly recommended! Way better than tinder! Only issue is it doesn't let me know when i have a msg sometimes, i must log in and see that i have left someone waiting, i presumed they had not msged me when they had? Still 5 stars but this needs fixing!"
Shakar Hershkovitz,Best dating App. More sophisticated and quality dating pool than Tinder. A few bugs in the operating software I think but overall it's smooth enough. Thanks for the great opportunities!
A Google user,Hey you know what it's not about app I'm on Plenty of Fish and Tinder they all seem to be working but I feel like the girls like this better cuz they have more control definitely was playing with them Double D's giggity giggity goo thanks bumble
Kylie Buckley,Seriously love this app. It doesn't waste your time or have weirdos constantly hitting you up because the girl is in charge. It's like tinder but wayyyyy better
Alex Egan,"App attempts to socially engineer the dating scene. Was great once, now sucks. Stick with Tinder unless you want to swipe on fake or outdated profiles all day."
Amy Smith,I feel safer on bumble than I do on Tinder so far so good. I like that you can send gifs
Meosha Polk,"A+ app, super fun and better than tinder"
A Google user,"Of all the dating apps, I dislike Bumble and Coffee Meets Bagel the most. Bumble very much feels superficial: like guys are on it just to see how many matches they can get but aren't interested in talking with or actually meeting someone. Guys sometimes unmatch with you immediately, and I found even when I swiped on weekends it didn't help with guys responding before the 24 hours were up. I didn't have any interesting or long conversations on here and, to be honest, felt there weren't that many POC users. Even though this app is supposed to be for dating, I've had more success with Tinder. I gave up on Bumble within a month, which says a lot because I'm stubborn. Oh well."
Lupo Cordero,"UPDATE AFTER +6 months: Don't waste your time, this app sucks big-time. I barely get one match a month, if lucky, and then women don't write and in 24h the match is gone. Don't even consider the paid option. Get tinder instead.   OLD REVIEW: I like the app in general. I dislike that it does not let you restrict the area of search to your city but rather starts displaying people 500km away when you run out of people in your proximity."
Michael Düwel,"Love it, much better than Tinder. Just somehow nicer, maybe more mature people."
JackJincklesJones Jr.,Is there a reason why I get no matches? Or do the girls on this app have higher standards than Tinder?
bwood1234qwert,Paid to boost as it said i had 2 likes to view but nothing there when i upgraded straight after. In addition have found few matches and silent people compared to tinder. Not recommended.
Shane P,"It's basically just a glorified Tinder, the only difference is the female has to make the first move in order to communicate"
Travis Beausoleil,I like the idea of the app.  How it looks and operates (the UI.)  But I can't stand how glitchy it is.  It's really amateur programming.  Messages sometimes don't show up.  New matches or messages sometimes disappear then reappear after awhile.  Hire a real programmer and it would be a great app that's better than Tinder.
Mike alll,Doesn't work at all. On tinder I get matched with some of the same people as I swipe on here and never get a match. Still never gotten a match. It's also very confusing and boring. Won't let you change anything that you have on you Facebook and is just all around a poor app for meeting anyone
Mike O'Brien,I believe there is something wrong with the app. I've gotten only one match so far this time I've had it. I deleted it last time because I wasn't getting any. This time my single match messaged me and when I checked back she was gone (ok she unmatched me). However I figured I'd check back again because I feel there is something wrong with the app and there she was again. I've been extremely successful on tinder. Don't see why I would do well on that app and then have nothing to speak of on this one.
Zack Halverson,It's Great app however literally no one uses it often. On tinder you have to open to show up. On bumble my friend said she hadn't opened the app in weeks and I saw her in my feed. They should have a thing where you can't show up on the feed unless you active.
Charles McGlothlin,Really like it actually. More than Tinder. As a guy I feel the woman on here are more intelligent and motivated to put in actual effort into dating.
Chelsea Hilbert,I've tried multiple times to use this app as it seems like a better alternative to Tinder but I don't have a Facebook and I don't plan on getting one. I understand the need for safety but it seems like by doing so they're keeping out a fair amount of people by not allowing some kind of additional setup option. Maybe if they change that I'll try again.
Rob Alfie,On tinder I get about 150 super likes a month for $20. Bumble you get about 15... that's pure roberry.... Bumble... what's going on ????
Nicholas Smith,Easy to use and cool concept. Better than tinder for sure.
Thebluelagoon,Better than Tinder
Obliv,"Its a feminists version of tinder, only worse."
A Google user,"Good for what it is, better looking people than tinder"
Mr Hoppy,"I do quite like the app as a tinder alternative, but can you make it so I can either copy text from another person's message or open links they send me? I'm having to manually type out youtube links in chrome"
Jessika Hallett,"Been on here for awhile, sent over 30 likes and not one reply. But..I sure did get 50 Matches in queue waiting for me that  I can view for payment.. seriously?  I hate Tinder and this app seemed perfect but hard to meet anyone friend or otherwise with no responses. Very disappointing 😐"
Shannon Billings,"""network issues""? No? I'm in WiFi? I tried reinstalling and it still won't work. I'm afraid my matches are all going to time out bc of the idiotically short period of time you get to actually contact someone. Just a way to force you to pay money I guess. This app is just tinder with technical issues. Don't waste your time."
M C,Rubbish. Tinder is better
Stivi Sholla,Pretty good app with the potential to be better than tinder
Simon Guy,"Not the greatest experience 2nd time around using this app. Tinder seems to be alot more proactive at getting your profile on the screen of prospective active bio matches. Went from 10 matches a day on here to deleting bio to start fresh then not one match in 3 weeks. Support returned with a 'no problems' response, it's obvious there was. Account now deleted."
J.M. Rhapsody,"Considering the number of people I swipe right on, I can't believe I'm not getting any matches. What a joke of an app. At least Tinder gives you matches. Better off using that."
Ryan Attwood,"Easy to use, clean interface.  Prefer this to Tinder by a mile"
Eric Moran,"Pretty decent. Not sure if this is any better than Tinder, but only one way to find out. The lay-out is nice, and it simply walks you through everything."
T H,"Tried it for about 5 minutes. Not able to even write a summary about yourself and what you're looking for? Also, in reading others' reviews,  should be no time limit or message restrictions. Tinder is better but wasn't even impressed with that. I guess if you have to pay for a decent site, match is where to be 😉"
Leo Astudillo,It's like tinder but with real women
Afoke Peter,"Terrible, no matches at all and a lot of the users are inactive. Tinder is better, more active. Even OK cupid is better. But this is trash"
Bob Smith,"App does better than tinder at verification but you still gotta watch out for traps, always self verify via social media"
Angie,"This app is the worst. It's so slow, some of my matches disappear because it never downloaded correctly . Also, no one ever writes back. Worst than Tinder."
A Google user,"A waste, not one match, I got more connections from Tinder. Over 50 this app is either a scam or full of bogus profiles. Deleted for good."
Chace Ahlborg,great!! better than tinder
Daniel Fernández,No matches at all... come on I'm not THAT ugly! I liked the concept but ups back to tinder it is.
Shiv Patel,"Very buggy. Didn't get notified with either of the two girls I supposedly matched and I wonder, did they get notified for matching me? Not particularly great considering they have 24 hours to initiate - tough considering both are professionals. Push notifications is on. Making you pay for Super Swipe? The girls are way hotter than Tinder, though how many are actually active? Came across my friends girlfriends account who's been in a relationship for nearly 2 years - all photos are old with long hair etc (before anyone suggests she's cheating!)"
Jordan Steen,This app blows. I live in an area with a massive population. You're lucky if you get a match a month.    Tinder is way better.  Hell plenty of fish is probably better.
Omar Rodriguez,Garbage app and boring I'm going back to tinder
A Google user,"The absolute worst version of a downgraded Tinder, who's idea was it to give women the power to message first anyway when they do exactly the opposite of that? Once matched they will never message you! Bumble is the most pure garbage app I think I've ever used and should be banned from the Google Play Store. I feel sorry for anyone that pays for their crappy services."
Sam Johnson,"There are a lot of problems with this app, but chief among them is that it is really only for straight people. They have set up the entire system to benefit women, which is fine but what about relationships that don't involve women? For gay men this is just a bad version of Tinder with far fewer options to choose from."
No,At least tinder gives you ONE free super like a day. Also the notifications clearly don't work. I missed matches because of this
Ross B.B.,"I never get any matches. I don't know if it's just me, maybe I'm too ugly for bumble but, I've had more luck on okc and tinder then whatever this dumb app has to offer"
A Google user,"Quality over quantity is how I would describe this app. You'll be getting a lot less matches over an app such as Tinder, but Bumble makes up for it in the quality of the matches. I've had way more quality interactions in Bumble then other apps, as it flips the table on gender roles and puts the ball in the lady's court. I find that because of this, the people you end up matching with are the ones that actually are willing to put forth the effort to connect with you."
J Leone,"I have been using for a few months and have had only three matches with no one initiating conversations.  Over the same time period I've used other, similar apps like tinder and have had more matches and people actually engaging in conversations, so either this app is flawed in the way it matches people, people are not using as regular as the 24 hour message period requires or ladies in my area using this app have insanely high standards.  Complete time waster."
Jeremy Lavine,"The vast majority of the profiles appear fake: they're uniformly pretty, thin, white girls with airbrushed photos and unrealistic jobs. I suspect the company put these in themselves as filler, rather than some 3rd party spammers as you get on Tinder. Of course their marketing people deny it. Otherwise, the whole concept of the app is flawed. Women do not send more opening messages just because they're the only ones who can do so, and they don't start sending quality messages. This app offers nothing."
Joey McNamara,A classier version of tinder.
A Google user,"Horrible, boys still wants sex only & the bff section... Now I know why girls kinda sucks. I can see tinder all over again"
Antonio Fruci,Excellent UI and a great interaction improved if compared with Tinder.
Marcus Jones,"Fair warning... you'll be disappointed if you're a male. I get slammed with matches on tinder but if I'm lucky, 1 a week on here. That's after paying for the subscription. It's not my profile or distance/age settings. Hopefully you other dudes are having better luck than me."
DarnellBlanc R,"I love it. My matches tend to be of higher quality, compared to tinder that is"
Stuart Nicholson,"Can't fix the Location, like Tinder. Actually, I'm using Timber on Windows Phone."
Drew Colpurs,"A much better company and business model than Tinder with a better user base (in my experience). Though it also has far fewer matches, even with the subscription (in my experience, maybe I'm just ugly 😝). But I met the person I'm now seeing on here, so it's great (again, in my experience)."
Irene Theo,"I have never been treated more unfairly by anything or anyone in my life, and I wish I was being dramatic by saying that. Bumble decided to irrevocably ban me, without giving me an explanation or a courtesy e-mail.  When I inquired why I couldn't log in anymore was told ""you have been permanently banned and this decision was final because we received complaints and found enough evidence to ban you"" I looked over the guidelines (again) and found nothing to be in violation of. I had a link to my spotify account (which is not selling anything). The only thing I can think of is people complaining that I'm fake as I didn't authenticate myself which is mea culpa but if that was grounds to permanently ban me with not so much as a courtesy e-mail to warn me, than you are a sham app and shame on you. I haven't had a chance to communicate with anyone yet so there should be ZERO complaints for rudeness or anything.... Anyway, I'm confused and angry at the injustice imparted upon me. I have nothing nice to say about this app or your team quite frankly....your lag time getting back to my inquiry....not even a complaint but a bloody question, like 2 weeks later is ridiculous.  Just a little piece of advice, you should always give your members the benefit of the doubt....you know....innocent until proven guilty....and send an e-mail so that if they are in danger of something as drastic as an irrevocably permanent ban they may either ammend or defend what it is they're being accused of. #tinderftw tinder is so much better"
LostPromise,"This is the 4 app added to my list of not to use. Normally I wait 1 year before reviewing an app but I have now hit a wall after 7 days of use according to the app I have looked at all the members of the opposite sex within my city and NOT have received 1 message of response meaning that where I am those members that I looked for that all had verified accounts and descriptions that caught me interest are not interested in a person such as me... I checked it every day and swiped every day. I'm not looking for hookup that's why I stay away from tinder, and I not going to pay anymore money like I did with eharmoney and match with 1 year of paid membership each when all results are nothing... though I like how the app is a good medium to other apps i have tried. It just a greater model comparable to zooks... This app has great features but the members in my area are either shallow or hypocritical to what they say their looking for given how easy the app state's conversations are started. I even paid for 1 coin for super swipe on... This app may be simplistic and user friendly but user base is might be snobby  (personal opinion). Say what you must but just from my experience I must say born and raised Texans recommendation is STAY AWAY.   P.S.  please do not cut paste your generic reply that I have read on others replies bumble"
Micky Andrew,"I've had it for weeks and never matched with anyone that I know of. I'm a professional model too which seems strange. Going back to tinder, bye guys"
Taylor Chappell,"Idk what it is, but I like it more than Tinder. Good time killer."
SchnozBott,"Bumble's deck algorithm sucks.  It's also stacked with fake looking accounts.  Even if you get matches on there, most of the women will not even start talking.  At least on Tinder, there's equity."
M &M,Decent app . But tinder is better since i can make the first move.
cole vance,"Plenty of matches, but no one ever speaks.....Tinder is a better....or real life interaction. Update....Now I don't get matches at all anymore, pointless product."
A Google user,It is much better than Tinder.
Lauren Scott,I couldn't even get past the tutorial. I have a bad crack in my screen and I can't actually swipe right. On tinder it has the swiping AND BUTTONS
Jessica Kasper,"People actually respond on this app unlike tinder. Girls, YOU MESSAGE FIRST. Thats the whole point of the app. Guys literally cannot message first. If you arent getting any matches then either lower your standards or pick better photos of yourself. Its not always the app's fault so stop blaming them. In the beginning, they let you see who likes you before hand but then you have to pay for it afterwards. I did and thought it was worth it.  Seriously though if youre not getting matches, maybe its you and not the app."
Frank Kudrna,"Bumble is pretty efficient. You get 6 photos and about 300 characters. It would be nice to get more characters to describe yourself. The big thing that makes this app so nice is that the women seem to be a bit higher class than the other apps like Tinder. I don't know how women select which app to use, but this app seems to have a lot of people from Sunny Isles, doctors, lawyers, Etc. Don't get me wrong, there are such people in the other apps as well, but this app seems to lack the people that look like they live in the hood. People on here seem to know what they want, which is nice. I don't get as many responses as I did with Tinder, though. And, unfortunately, I'm still using the app. Hopefully my mate will find me soon! Good luck, and happy swiping!"
Nurin,"I like the shake feature in case you want to go back, the guys are cuter on here than Tinder, like the expiry feature but wish it was 48 hours, also would like option to super like a couple times for free"
Josh Swain,Better then Tinder!
Mike Harrison,"Don't restart your account.  They don't give you any more matches if you do.  I pay for premium and they still don't.  Even if I was getting matches, tinder is way better"
Cody Gover,"5 days not a single match, you think tinder is bad whoooooooooooo watch out this is something else!"
Devin Dyquisto,Worse UI than Tinder by far. Bio section even worse with most women
Hayden Iles,So far way better than tinder people seem more serious which is nice for a change
A Google user,"As a 6'4"" guy that gets tons of matches on tinder, this thing was a waste of time for me."
A Google user,"Fourth time over the last year giving this app a chance, and am more dissappointed than ever. I identify as non binary and bumble has no accomodation for this whatsoever, at least tinder tries. I understand the concept puts limits this but in this case it feels like exclusion, not exclusivity. Also after swiping through about 7 people, one of whom being my roommate who deleted her account years ago, bumble told me I was 'all caught up'. Done with this app."
Adam Jensen,Better than tinder.nice UI
Artur Łaba,Perfect App to gier new contacts and propably get in love because thats better thanks tinder its App with class and coulture
Smiae,I'm not sure why but women are much more attractive in Bumble than Tinder. Maybe it attracts more serious people that put in an effort. It's also fantastic to have women make the first move. Down with the old patriarchal rules that put undo pressure on men! This is great!
Nicholas Ierubino,"Got only one lunch date after being on here a year. The women don't talk.  You get like 3 messages back and forth, and that seems to be it. I know that the women here are real because some I know, personally.  Set my mileage limit and it keeps changing it on me. Still better then Tinder."
Milosz Janda,Better than tinder but still shall give a least a tial of coins...
A Google user,Better than tinder
A F,"Stick to tinder. 1 match in 4weeks vs 50+ matches on tinder, same pics,same description. Your profile wont show unless you buy premium boost..."
Daniel Friday,A bad idea.....trying to be tinder with women having to message first = nobody talking
Scott Lawton,"Bumble is supposed to be the more ""genuine"" alternative to Tinder. It's hard to see it as genuine as there are so many fake profiles, only there to get you to buy credits."
Joe Robbins,"Tinder is far better, get 10 matches on tinder before I've even had one on bumble"
Henry Bachmann,On tinder I normally get one match a day now. On this thing it's like 1 a week if lucky and because the girls have to talk first and they never do the match goes away after 24hrs.
l a,"The very few people who still have this app downloaded won't message you if you happen to match. It's a worse version of tinder because women are far less likely to make the first move and when they finally do get a match they don't know what to say so they'll just ignore you and keep swiping, lol."
Kristin Martin,"Believe it or not some people do not have a fb and don't want to create one for a dating website. This website as well as Tinder requires you to have a fb account. Facebook is just full of drama and a way for nosey people to dig around in your personal life without you knowing. Anyways, maybe you should think of the option of creating a profile without being connected to another site for once! Just some food for thought. Until then this app, as well as others will get one star...(Wrote this comment 7.2016 it is now 11.2017 and I'm not going to change my stars bc you're still unable to create an account without having a fb profile. Smh)"
Patricia B,"Good dating app, but slowly becoming more like Tinder"
S KELLEY,Need a 'like' button as tinder does rather than only swiping.
Souless Slime,"I find matches in tinder and okcupid like every three days, barely anything here at all."
Geeoh Neechuh,Just yellow tinder. That's really it.
Jordan Alexander,Almost great the women seem classier and more in my age range than tinder etc. But the expiring convo thing is dumb. We're grown ups. We don't have time to be obsessing over an app everyday just trying to go on a first date.
Shan Mahmood,"Truthfully, these apps are shallow. It works, and I've been on dates because of it, but between tinder, CMB and bumble, they've given a new depth to shallowness. Now we all have options, but we can't find an anchor."
Adam 2763,Downloaded this app a few days ago.... i think the concept of a woman messaging frist is stupid... just vecause inknow ky experience on tinder or pof has been thatbthey never message first.... and so far ove had 4 woman message me so i must say im surprised lol... the app is pretty mint 👌
Winston Sullivan,Better than tinder. Fo sho.
Eric Nelius,This is a more advanced version of tinder. I'd definitely recommend it.
Ethan Reding,a better tinder
Ryan Tooes,A refreshing experience over Tinder! I seem to get more matches on here for some reason. Only annoying thing is that push notifications are either on or off you can't specify which notifications you want to receive.
Anton Angelo,Marvellous alternative to tinder
Fah Bee Oh,"It's like Tinder, only you get to see your rejection count down for 24hrs."
Jason Hall,This app sucks. I got like 10 matches the first day and nothing since. Their algorithm seems to only favor a small number of men. I still get plenty of matches on tinder so I'm having a hard time believing my profile is so unappealing.
DeMonté Lane,A lot of beautiful women that I never match with. Same pics on tinder and I get 4 matches a day on average. Plus you have to wait for women to make first contact. Generally speaking women aren't as assertive.
Michael Salvato,"At first it was cool.....lots of great matches. Since recently updated, it is now taking forever to load and it regularly locks up or crashes. That sends me back to Tinder......not fun."
Jon Tu,not a bad tinder clone. ok cupid still better because you can message anyone without having to match first. not sure how else bumble could set itself above other apps that do the same thing or give better incentives for people to use it
Eric Lehnen,I find more success with Tinder actually.
Kevin Sloan,"It's basically tinder but you have to wait for girls to message first, which happens rarely even if you match. Good way to pass the time, have met some people but not that great"
Mo Hughes,"I'm good looking ad honestly,the match rate doesn't seem realistic. Barely any matches. Tinder is a different planet, for the better. Step your algorithm game up"
Josh Holman,It's a lower grade tinder with less creeps but no one ever replies and it takes forever to get any responses.
AB Fitness,"Great app, way better than tinder"
Jeffrey Roberts,Two weeks in and I have zero matches.  Something smells fishy.  As a 6 ft 2 good looking guy I should at least have 1 match in a major city.  Signed up for Tinder 3 days ago and I have almost 100 matches....
Ryan Rockstad,This app is better than tinder. They have an actual separate allocation for people who just want friends vs dating. However I feel like all account photos should be verified before you can even start.
Keith Heim,"Don't bother, you can meet twice the people on Tinder."
Devon Hill,Legitimately worse than tinder even though tinder is horrible as well. The whole concept of this site is awful. Women have to write the men first. It's a nice change from the norm but realistically that idea will never entirely work in our society. An even bigger issue with this site is that it doesn't have nearly enough ACTIVE users.
Eric Smyth,Pretty sweet. Beats tinder and anything else is irrelevant.
A Google user,"I the app. It is easy to use. The only thing I would wish for is some more filtering options like other online dating services, but I do not think that is the point of this app. It is pretty much tinder, but with nicer people."
Ricardo González,"Not bad, very much like tinder but better results..."
John Swalm,Better than tinder
Alberto Serna Rivas,"Don't like it for a lack of matches. I do get matches on tinder, and have badically the same profile. With the few matches I got, the women didn't write."
Moonlitphillips Gaming,"I've had this and tinder and pof, must be me cause I get no matches whatsoever boring to swipe, I may as well flip through a magazine. It's pretty much the same thing no talking or matches just pictures"
Rudolf Horak,"This is worse than TINDER. You swipe right, nobody ever responds.  One day just to experiment I shipped all my matched and no response, delete this junk and go to Match or Tinder."
Elizabeth Sauve,"Its easy to use, and guys are much more responsive than tinder. A few weirdos who like dom women, but if that floats your boat..."
kristi clark,"Same great concept as tinder, but better ppl, and I like that girls make the first move."
David Smith,"Like Tinder but with fewer connections.  Women listed were generally more attractive, but who cares if they don't match for whatever reason?  Found matches on all other apps I've used,  so yeah not impressed by this one."
Courtney Ferguson,boobeez way better'n tinder
Krista Mckerrell,Oh so much more classy than Tinder. Thank you Bumble
A Google user,Stick to Tinder. This app algorithm only works sometimes or if you pay a sub. Plenty of fake-ish profiles top of the list too
Graham Kutzner,Pretty sure this is a viable app of you act like a human being. Same with tinder but most people don't know about this app that really should. Would reccomend
sean bawwa,Tinder for snobby girls.
A Google user,Either I've never got watch in 4 months or something wrong. I have no probs in tinder but no matches on hete. Don't get it
Garrett Simpson,Classy tinder
Shaun Ryan Savard,Needs to give one super swipe like tinder does..to expensive otherwise cause you still can't talk first..
Jason,Easy to use. Would live to have desktop version just like Tinder's  latest roll out.
Sierra Mullican,"Seems to be a slightly classier version of tinder, not bad"
Bill Whitlock,"Swiping is slower than Tinder.  Also, Bumble really needs to stop letting people link their Instagram accounts. Yeah it's nice being able to see more pics of someone than they put on Bumble, but the trade off makes it not worth it, and here's the tradeoff: I've seen too many females' profiles say something like ""If you want to talk, msg me on IG"", and then they just decide if they wanna talk to you or not. It totally defeats the purpose of the app. Guessing this is why I've had WAY better response on Tinder than Bumble: I don't use IG."
Why Tigr,"Seems like a great idea, but women are always innundated by would-be suitors so pretty much every right-swipe will generate a match for them. This seems like a ""hot or not"" and tinder rip-off. While there are a lot of beautiful women here, chances of them wasting hours of their day swiping either direction are minimal. Good luck!"
Teryn Green,You can only filter women by age and distance. You can't message women yourself. And women are likely never to respond anyway. And other reviewers have said this app is by the same creators as Tinder. Seriously. Don't waste your time guys.
jorey D,"Women HAVE to message first. Let it be known! A good app if you are into traveling, dogs, women not into hookups, hiking, and foodies. Otherwise stick to tinder because almost every bumble profile is pretty much that."
Taylar Price,The guys on here are quite humble for the most part. Much better than guys on Tinder!
Calum Coburn,"Better than Tinder, hope they catch up to okcupid"
A D,Better than tinder
Mitchell Fricke,It won't show a match until I have an hour left to respond. Now it's not even showing any connections at all it's been 4 weeks and I haven't had one connection. When I first got the app I would get about 6 a day. This app used to be better than Tinder now it's worse and I'm deleting it right now.
Michael Siemon,It's another shallow mainly pictures dating app where there are probably tons of guys and only a few women.  After a few weeks using the app I have yet to have any conversations.  This is the same reason I ultimately ditched Tinder too.
A Google user,"Very good program, girls having to message first and the fact that it erases connections after 24 hours give them the initiative to reach out to you. Love the app and the idea behind it! Far better than tinder!"
Chris Porro,"Like the time limit, but has led to far fewer face to faces then tinder. Wish profile was longer. Fonts on profile are small, low contrast, and a pain to read. Please make them easier to read please."
Morgan Schonfelder,"Tinder for women by women.   Speaking as a guy, the main thing I've gotten from the app is that I should take more / better pictures and update Facebook.   And, like Tinder, no one (literally, in my area) is ""just looking for friends""."
OGS Fresh,Better than tinder!
Chris Taylor,Even more difficult to get matches than Tinder. 24 hrs isn't enough time.
A Google user,Full of fake profiles and flaky women.    The people that are tinder shy go here.
Felipo Soares,Lacks the data-based AI of Tinder for candidate selection
Joakim Juel,"Easy to use, has a lot of nifty features in all but Its just like tinder with the freemium"
Terrence Nowicki,"As ineffective as Tinder thus far due to (reportedly) a high volume of dead profiles, though the idea is good."
Hunter Jeffus,More hot girls than tinder.
Alex Omiotek,Women messaging first with the 24h limit is an interesting but efficient alternative to Tinder.
Brian Ask,"A lot like tinder. Also if you match, it shouldnt matter who messages first. Also there are some matches who have not used the app in a long time which makes it difficult to know who is active."
Joseph Chamberlain,It's better than tinder
A Google user,"quality guys, forces you to reach out so your matches don't get stale, like in tinder"
Char Holliday,"Seems that all the negative reviews r coming from men. For a woman, ive only been using the app intermittently for a week. The guys seem real and genuine and im getting responses back about 50% of my matches (not a fault of the app). Better than tinder"
John Goundry,"Haha this blows Tinder outta the water, the design and UI makes a hell of a lot more sense, the ability to scroll through pictures before swiping is a nice touch.     I would like to see the ability to choose Spotify songs as opposed to getting a preselected mismatch that's not quite right, also the ability to play a select song in app instead of opening Spotify (Like Tinder, ya'know)  Love it"
Seth Wright,I can get matches on Tinder.. but never on this app.. weird.
Sean McDowell,Less matches than Tinder but at least the matches are real women. Plus no wasting time with women who only collect matches for an ego boost
Aurelius Tirto,Bit disappointed that I got no messages :/ but I like the idea that the ladies get to message first. Would rate higher if I actually get more matches than tinder. Also the unlimited likes is a plus.
Makayla Anderson,Due to the fact I've noticed I get barely any matches comparison to Tinder. 24 hours for somebody to respond is too small of a limit. And the upgrade doesn't seem worth it whatsoever.
Eden Stewart,I get more matches here than on tinder ;)
Tom Fitzpatrick,"Im getting wayyyy less matches than tinder. And all the girls im shown seem to be perfect 10s. Annoying - i have no chance. Im probably a bit above average myself, so show me girls who are similar.   The other thing i find stupid about this app is that it simultaneously tells me i have matches in my que and also that there are no more people in my area.   Beyond that, it lags a lot between swipes."
Nick Peterson,Pretty much tinder but not
Angela D,Huge turn off that you have to pay to rematch if you don't get back on the app in time. Went back to tinder.
Jon DeInteritus,"So bumble does a lot of things to make sure profiles are real, ok. What if the profiles are real and the users aren't using their profiles does it matter if they're real? Seems to me like no one is using bumble. I get more interactions on tinder. Why? Maybe their user base is larger and people are still using the app. Bumble is also pretty expensive in comparison to tinder what are you really paying for anyway. I haven't noticed a difference."
Seth Siegel,Tinder is a waste if time
Casi Matheson,"Easy to use. However not many people actually check their accounts regularly so the expirations I feel need to be extended. Life gets in the way. Also I feel that, like, I live in one city but travel to see family in another. Tinder has a swiping from, option, if you don't want to swipe from the location you're in. I think that it would be good for this app to do that too. Because when I travel I don't ever use it because if I match with anyone I will automatically unmatch with them if they are over a certain distance. However there aren't many scam or spam accounts. Not as many people looking for hookups."
Aaron Anderson,"I like that not only are none of my potential matches porn bots, but 99% of them are local. Way better than Tinder."
MrBdc2013,Hits and misses kinda tinder but classier lol
Nate B,"// , I think this app exposes some serious flaws in Tinder style dating, but does little to fix them."
Alex Lablaiks,"Just my opinion: this app has less false positives than tinder due to lady's contacting first. If you don't want to waste your time on uninterested people but can deal with less matches, this is the app for you."
Jose Torres,Not enough matches for it to be considered an adequate option. It's the worse option to Tinder that is already horrendous itself.
Luke Russell,Beats tinder by a mile
King Mastery Official,works better than tinder
Joseph Bowman,"Tons of repeat profiles (that I had swiped right or left on the day before), tons of unverified profiles, boring, and just not as good as Tinder. I also don't understand the ""women message first"" aspect. You can't message on Tinder if you match with someone, so doesn't that take care of unsolicited messages. I am unsubscribing, and uninstalling the app. Don't bother with your copy+pasted corporate message."
Zak Skinner,"It's like tinder and hot or not had a baby. I loke that women message first, and i haven't met a bot yet!"
Reece Chambers,"Modeled like Tinder except better in every way. Better matches, more matches, women message first, profile viewing easier, so many more great enhancements."
David Wesby,"Tinder, but sexist."
FoesFlyDennis,"The text/comment field should have more space. I've had much more interaction with girls and at least 7 very nice dates in just over 1 month on Tinder. Have gotten only a few connections and 1 or 2 messages on Bumble and zero dates. IMO this is because on Tinder, I can capitalize on a female's initial interest and message her first. This allows opportunity to build more interest with wit, suggestions for fun date activities or deeper dialog than the terse comment field allows. The 24 hour expiration of a connection is too short too. I don't see why it should expire at all. If 1 of the 2 people want to disconnect, let either 1 do it manually, even if a message has been sent. Some girls don't realize they have to message first. They are waiting for the guy to make first move but he can't. Yes, I've read that in their profile comments. They often say, ""I'm shy so message me first"", or ""I just realized I have to message first"". Also, it seems many people use this app only for browsing and want to jump straight to Snapchat or Instagram. I don't want accounts on those mediums. There should be a simple way to indicate what social media each user is on so everyone understands what methods of contact are available for someone of interest. For those of us who don't look like Henry Cavil or Chris Hemsworth in pictures, we need opportunity to make other assets known: life accomplishments & goals, maturity, financial & emotional stability, better idea of our romantic & affectionate qualities and other dialog, more appropriate between 2 who have expressed at least some degree of interest. As your system is today, selections are made based 95% on how good users look in pictures. That's why Tinder consistently gets better results... except for Idris Elba ;)"
Shane OReilly,Better than tinder
Bogsta Black,Needs to be easier to flick through photos like Tinder
D W,"Too many fake profiles, don't worry Tinder is even worse."
Sam Lang,Girls never respond on Tinder? Well they don't say anything here either!
Cliff t,"I use bumble, cmb, and tinder. Of the 3,bumble is a colossal waste of time. (for a guy)"
V,"Lots of bugs, barely 3 profiles in my area and immediately it was all foreign tourists looking for a hook up. Profiles with even less effort than tinder, only saw two guys bother to write a bio. Probably a great app in LA or NY, but in Europe doesn't seem to be worth trying."
Christian Spondulicks,Get fewer matches on here than I do on tinder. And None of the girls initiate which is the whole point. Lol.
Eric Sutherland,Better then tinder..  you don't run out of likes 😊
Walle brown,"A nice and respectable dating app that is relatively simple to use (like Tinder). Very cozy, however, you have to pay to super like and that is the only reason I'm giving four stars."
Sam W,"Got 0 matches over a week of swiping. I don't think I'm a bad looking guy? So either the app doesn't work, most of the girls don't use it anymore, or the girls on here have much higher standards than those on tinder."
Andrew Fiorillo,"I like a lot of the features and general feel, especially in contrast with tinder. Push notifications don't work though, so sometimes I've missed matches."
D Chambers,It's like Tinder - don't take it seriously and you won't go insane
Lawrence,"It's quite an innovative and cool idea. Compared to tinder it seems it more likely to chat once people match, but so few matches. Haven't used it much at the moment. I may change the review"
Randy Robbins,Better than Tinder.
Amir,"Just use tinder, women are cowards and hardly ever have the balls to message first"
Esteban Lopez,"Just like Tinder. It successfully kills my self steem by reminding me that of all the girls that subscribe, pretty much none like me.  It's been what... 3 weeks? Seriously, not one match?  Edit: It's cool the developers replied... Fixed profile, still not a single match... As I said, just like Tinder, reminds me of how much no one likes me."
jordan younger,Beats tinder/10
Pat McGlone,Don't think girls use it as much as tinder
C C,"Worse than tinder. With the rare match, she only has 24 hours to send the first message.... And they never do."
A Google user,Could do better to matching with mutual friends lol like tinder and a bigger bio character area
David E. Rodriguez,Have been using for two weeks and not a single match. Used the same pics in tinder and had tons. Something not right
fabmygoodness,Way better than tinder. No one has asked me for a nude and guys actually chat with me for more than 2 minutes after realizing I'm not here for one night stands. It's great because I can look forward to talking to a guy
Nick Hollis,More real (not fake or bot) profiles than Tinder!  But that's about it;  not a lot of people swiping or chatting but possibly because less popular than apps like Tinder...So the good with the bad.
j d,Make it faster like Tinder the app pictures load way too slow
Ivan Ricardez,"The app gives women the power to initiate relationships, but most women who match with you won't even send a message to say Hi and as a male you can't initiate the conversation either. (I have the same profile on other apps and have had several matches on Zoosk and Tinder, who I actually talk to. Don't waste your time here.)"
A Google user,Better than tinder
Ryan 1h3 Lion,Bumble&gt;Tinder It's not even close
Gabe Lazar,Better than tinder
A Google user,Cool app but very slow. Pics take forever to load. It's not my connection since other apps like tinder work fine with the same exact connection.
Matt Segawa,I literally have about 10x more matches on Tinder and have been using Bumble the same amount of time. Maybe it's my area but no matches + no convo = boring. Seems like an ego boost app.
A Google user,It seems cool at 1st. Top talent shows 1st then you start scraping the bottom of the barrel. I've swooped right on several profiles but never a match. On tinder I matched frequently and had great results. Must be some ego booting app for girls IDK.
Roc Hoops,Prefer this interface over tinder. More attractive people on here than any other app... Likely bots.  Nice way to waste time.
chris routley,Better than tinder
droid327,"They need to fix their algorithm to delete inactive accounts.  It shows you high-rated photos more often, but they're all beautiful women who probably created an account, deleted the app the next day, and have just been racking up swipes since then since it shows them to everyone first.  Also uses a lot more data than other tinder type apps, just be warned.  Burned almost a gig on me last month before I looked at the usage.  Despite this, it makes you wait for loading a lot while swiping.  Other than that, works fine, same as all the other swipe-dating apps.  No major bugs, decent quality of people, and ""girls talk first"" seems to let them put their guard down a bit, which is nice for us guys who aren't creepers."
Kalani Cooner,It is very nice and easy to use. And not many fake profiles like some of the other places Tinder is horrible with that
B C,All dating apps are some bs. I test it out by swiping right on every single girl and still never got a lile back. Been using stupid dating apps for over a year and never had any lucky not even once. I paid for a service once on tinder even then no luck.
Matthew Stubler,Way better than tinder. No bots!
Will Derkacs,Not enough matches i have 5 on here and 110 on tinder
Alex Caron,Better than tinder.  Seems like there's a lot less fake accounts and spam.  You actually talk to real people.
Roberto Elias,Too many matches just say hi to keep you on the list and then nothing more. Might as well be tinder then.
Jared Law,"When a member of the sex in which you're interested actually uploads decent quality photos, clearly showing their face, their body type, and exhibiting aspects of their personality, it can be an extremely useful tool to determine initial attraction for those of us who are visually-motivated.   Obviously I'm referring to us guys.   And as a normal man, nothing is better at determining initial attraction than the sort of photos described above, of a beautiful woman.   Obviously, Bumble has nothing on OkCupid for determining medium- and long-term compatibility, but it's great for initial attraction.   That said, it is definitely better, for those looking for actual relationships and far deeper, than Tinder.  Tinder is for hookups, Bumble is for something more, and if you properly use OkCupid, it can help you find the one.   If Bumble Incorporated all of the questions and matching features of OKCupid, then it would be far and away the best dating app out there!"
Amanda Vadon,"The app itself is pretty good. Its the people that end up sucking. So much chatting for nothing, or guys just trying to hook up, I thought that's what tinder was for. Ugh"
sandra vlza,The concept is great and a bit of an upgrade from tinder and other dating sites.
Nathan Barrett,"Same as tinder only women talk first. 24 hour time limit is stupid, then they want you to pay to extend it. No filters on who you can search except distance. Stop being like tinder be more like POF"
Alex F,"This app has ruined dating. Men have become apathetic. It has even ruined tinder. Men on there don't make the first move anymore, either."
Max Martin,Been swiping for 2 weeks and still no matches. Having more success on tinder and pof
Question Everything,More hotter girls than tinder.
Dominic Gonzales,"Probably just ugly but i have a tinder to see the difference, never gotten a match on bumble but have like 35 on tinder.... nobady really uses this app any more or im just ugly"
Travis Brace,10x more functional and less buggy than Tinder
bradley Rivers,Better than tinder
Mike Brick,Hands down better than Tinder.
Christopher Clinton,"Good app, free for women (as it should be), way better UI, better customer support and functionality then tinder.  Simpler than the normal dating sites but -2 stars for poor connection over networks that arent blazing fast and $20/month is overpriced.    It could use better location control like being able to set 1 home location if you don't want to be matched with others beyond a particular distance when you travel. Due to good customer service and free basic access for men it is really close to being 4 stars."
Steve C,Over 20 matches and only 1 lady said anything.  Fact is most women want the guy to talk first. Fix that and it's a lot better than tinder
T Runions,Bumble sucks compared to tinder the fact that there's a 24 hour time limit to say something before the match expires is not cool
Daniel Lauzon,"I love in seattle where bumble seems to be populated with very beautiful bit very normal women. I'd love a filter option for interests that you could turn on and off, something simple. Without it I'm left swiping 90% of the time and forced to wander back to okcupid and tinder to find my fellow weirdos and queerdos."
A Google user,"Good app. Better than tinder, but it'd be nice if the boost option didn't exist."
Chip Parker,"App is ass, just stick to Tinder ."
Kellie S,Reminds me of a knockoff tinder. I didn't find the overall app an enhancement to my dating search.
Jared Figueiredo,Stupid. No one is active on the accounts. Tinder is better and worse at the same time.
Rick james Rios,You have to sign up with Facebook thats lame. Its just like tinder who was another tinder
Leah Shuck,"It's cut and dry - people either respond or they don't. And when they don't, they disappear from your chat history so you never have to think about them again! More promising than Tinder, less serious than Match, I'm in!"
A Google user,"Awesome app, better than tinder lol"
Cole Forkheim,"Nicely designed, easy to use, a lot like tinder in the aspect that paying money makes you more successful"
A Google user,"Its ok, way better than tinder. But a little dull no one  talks. Almost makes me miss all the messages I used to get from the tinder spambots."
Daniel Argil Aguilar,"2-3 matches a day on tinder and 0 on Bumble after a week and profile pool runs out after 3 swipes. You're better off using tinder, badoo or Jaumo."
Justin Comino,Fixes a lot of the problems Tinder has. Great app.
caio nunes,Worked better than tinder for me
Shawn Rolnin,"A lot like tinder, no matches after 3 days"
Paige,"So far, so good. Better than tinder."
Drew,"This app gives the woman 24 hours from matching with you to message you first before the window expires and she is unable to message you anymore. When in life does the woman make the first move? If this app wants to compete with tinder, they need to have open messaging once there is a match."
Truett,Just another tinder.
Nicholas de Leon,Better than tinder for sure
Aron Micallef,"The only thing I seem to be getting from this app is carpal tunnel in my swiping thumb. Are you sure most of the profiles on here are legit? Because even with a paid membership which enables me to see who has swiped right on me before we've matched, I don't seem to be getting any matches (and yes I've tried altering my profile, and I'm fairly certain I'm reasonably attractive enough because even on tinder i had my fair share of matches)."
A Google user,"I like it better than Tinder. It's easy to use and has a nice design. The matches expiring after only 24 hours is kind of annoying, and so is the fact that the option to extend the match only pops up when you first match with someone. Then the option disappears even though the match is expiring. Extend the expiration time to 48 hours to give people time to respond, and make the extend button available up until expiration please."
A Google user,"One feature that makes it better than Tinder : women are ""forced to respond""."
A Google user,Not as good as tinder and the women seem to all have major life issues.
Scotty Davidson,Worse than Tinder. 0 matches in two weeks.
M N,A complete waste of time. You can't message anyone or even send any sign to a matched person.  While women almost never like messaging guys first. And matches diappear in 1 day. So the whole experience is a complete bs and waste of time. Tinder is way better.
A Google user,"Just a bad concept. It doesn't actually change the dynamic of interaction at all, it just adds additional hurdles to online dating.  Even worse than tinder.  The one plus was the app was so depressing it got me talking to girls in public again, which I've been having exponentially better luck with."
Chris Boothby,"Super Likes should be bit cheaper. Good app though, layout and navigation etc. Much better profiles than Tinder. Not received any messages yet but hopefully hear from some girls soon..."
A Google user,"Love the premise, and the UI is heaps better than other dating apps, I really want to like it. The only issue? No matches.  I get at least 5x as many matches on apps like Tinder, and that's with Bumble set to a much, much wider radius.  Also, is someone able to explain why I'll be told a couple of profiles have liked me, only for it to disappear next time I log on?"
Alex Ludwig,"Never get any matches on here, I've had far better luck with tinder. Also, you will spend more time staring at the loading animation than you will spend looking at profiles. Slowest app I've seen so far."
A Google user,Ta led way to long to load up people's pick. My tinder takes half a second this app is like a minute for each pic n they're not worth waiting for
A Google user,"If no one is talking and responding to you,it's (you) not the app! I have a 100% responses  This app blows tinder away-and any other app I have used for Social dating apps!!"
Elijah Pheonix,"Exact same concept as Tinder, OKCupid, etc. except half the users are handicapped from the start. The number of 'Insta-models' and inactive profiles is also pretty high unfortunately. I'll give it another week or two to see if I get better results."
Christine Brubaker,People are way better looking than on tinder. Woukd be nice if you had more than 24 hours initially though.
That one Dude,"Let's start with the good.   Women have to message first. Which is dumb if we both like each other... Then  99% of the women message ""Hey lol"". (don't be that basic Betty 👧😔).   Have a personality please woman. 80%of ladies no zero in their bio that's sketchy and not mysterious.   But there are a few catches along with the CATFISHES.   The interface backwards and counterintuitive. Perhaps they are trying to separate themselves from Tinder.   The worst is typing your message that tiny reply box."
Brian surber,"Been on for a few days now, I like the functionality of this app over Tinder but it seems to be just another dating app where the ladies are out for $$ and not actually wanting to date.  I've had no messages just like on Tinder.  Also just like Tinder lots of Trannies!  Hey trans dudes if I wanted dick I'd be on Grindr!"
Etown,"Similar to Tinder, women starting conversation first is interesting concept however in my case it doesn't seem to be working out maybe it's not just that popular where I'm at I've had it for a few days and only gotten one match and no messages also some loading problems"
A Google user,Seems to be classier women on here than tinder.
A Google user,I subscribed which was not only not worth it but once I went through the app to delete it.  They still charged me a week later even though I deleted my profile.  Also the app itself isn't very great.  It's maybe a half of a star above tinder.  A contest between which app is worse is yet to be determined.
Bobby Seals,"Not really sure just yet, if the women are real have to see if they respond. Going to be tough making them make the first move... Since I've been on about 3 days I've swiped left allot less than tinder or any other dating app. Looks like better quality women but we'll have to wait and see if anyone matches me.. If nothing in the next week I would say it's a bust. I normally get allot of action on other dating apps but we will see...."
Kevin Qualy,"This and Tinder is one of the most tragic things that has happened to our generation. Swipe left or right, as if people are a commodity, completely 100 percent based off of how they look. There will come a day of reckoning where those that created such a cold, callous app will have to answer for this and the ruining of a generation."
Chance Salois,Seemingly better than tinder
Jessica Morris,It's better than tinder...
Tommi Partanen,Better than Tinder.
Thomas DiMaria,Great app. Better than tinder by far
Abraham Ortiz,"So much better than tinder, real people, no pressure."
A Google user,Much better than Tinder. I feel like I can fine better quality guys on here.
A Google user,Better than tinder.
Mathieu Cloutier,Love the idea. But only if it actually worked and got matches. The amount of women and quality is there but there are zero matches. I've swiped around 40-50 women but zero action. With tinder I'd have at least 10-20 for 50
Robbieh,Garbage. Like tinder wasn't already in favor of women. An app with the feminist mentality in mind is everything you need to know.
U F,"Keep seeing the same people despite having swiped left and have a wide radius. Lots of too good to be true and seriously professional looking photography seems suspect. I've had better luck on Tinder, which is a sad statement. If you're into black guys, don't bother at all. This feels like a cash grab to extend the 24 hour shot clock."
Lauren Pae,"People don't talk on it - used the app in Australia and had loads of conversations. Here in London, people are using it like Tinder and a total game for matches for their ego. It's pretty disappointing."
User Name,Better than tinder.
Dylan Kirkman,Good dating app. Better than tinder
Colbey Hair,"As an app, I rate it 5 stars. It does everything it promises to do.  As a service, I give it 2 stars. It's basically Tinder but with a much much pickier group of girls. If you're a young urban professional, you might do alright, but if you're a ""will-be,"" don't waste your time."
Jordan Allen,"However this app's matching algorithm works, it's really weird. I'm not particularly picky about my swipes (although all the educated beautiful people are put at the front of the stack when swiping), and get matches with really attractive women but it only happens once in a blue moon. Even if you've got a good profile that attracts people on other apps like Tinder, OKC or POF, this app seems to so rarely produce anything fruitful that it feels like a waste of time to be on it.   I think the concept has a lot of potential and the matches I have gotten have been interesting, it's just die exceedingly rare that it feels like unless you get lucky enough to be on the front of people's stacks all the time that it's just a waste to be on this app much."
Keegan York,Much better than Tinder for real connections.
Fantastic Dimensions,"Tried it for a while... maybe a month? Total let down. Sorry ladies, but it seems the last thing you need in the dating world is even more power. I only got one match in my time on the app, and she never messaged and disappeared after a couple days. If you thought Tinder was the worst, you haven't tried this one yet!"
Wyndamere,Better than tinder
B G,It's nice and probably better than tinder but I think bumble needs to delete accounts or something that been inactive for more than 60 days. Also to see when was the last time the user was on. That will make it better overall. I haven't found no matches in 2 days but I'm still gonna be looking.
Shaun Mcgrath,Pretty cool app. Definitely better than tinder lol
Ben Robertson,"Doesn't work while traveling, unlike Tinder."
Josh,"Same exact profile on my Tinder, only 7 matches in 2 months (I just swipe right all, no point filtering with such low performance), compared to dozens on Tinder, dead/doesn't show your profile to anyone unless you buy their stuff"
G F,"Bumble. Hmmm. More like Fumble. Totally dropped the ball with this one. Why? Let's make a list:  1. The Women are absolutely pretentious and shallow. If you're not 6ft tall, predominately white, and look like you just got off of Daddy's yacht-- you have no chance. Good luck maintaining your match's spending habits, too. Rarely is conversation ever initiated on behalf of the females. They, too, have next to nothing to say because you don't fit their ""standards"". They appear to be more concerned about their HEAVILY PHOTOSHOPPED array of faux photo shoots/wannabe model portfolio of them being caught mid-laugh in front of a beautiful landscape, or posing in their newest swimsuit (or lack thereof) on a beach they took a vacation on (1 of 50 they take yearly), or perfectly timed glance at the camera while drinking a glass of wine/alcohol (because their friend is a ""professional photographer"")  Hey, your ego is showing ;)  3. The matching system tried it's hand at switching up the conventional gender roles--- which is great--- if the women were actually of quality. This results in 0 messages sent and 0 received in 24 hours. Oops, end of your match! Sorry!  4. If you do manage to get a reply- DON'T MESS UP! It may be the only message you send and will seal your fate!  5. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT SUBSCRIBE.  It's a total scam. No, you will not receive more matches. You'll just be swiped left quicker than the rest. Tinder has much better incentives for their fees (e.g, Undo, Super Like, Travel, UNL swipes).  6. Why can you not undo a right swipe? People make mistakes, and bumble is more concerned about ""not hurting feelings"", so once you're locked in--- you can't go back. Leads to awkward encounters and more non-conversation.  7. Download Tinder and POF. Maybe OKCupid to check out match-making and view compatibility.   There ya go. 7 Reasons why."
Steve,"The creator of the app is an ultra feminist activist who believes women are superior to men, and takes extra steps in enforcing this. They have recently decided they are the judge of what is 'hate speech' and will block users they deem are in violation. (most likely men who piss off a few women)  This app will naturally die a slow death from the owners one reactionary decision after another. Her God complex is a sickness, happy to have uninstalled; get plenty enough willing ass from Tinder"
Joe Evans,"Eh, I get matches, but it never goes anywhere, tinder is better..."
Joseph Anderson,Better interface than tinder
Francisco Aragón,"24 hours to respond is too short, even with ONE free extension. You oughta give at least THREE like with backtrack, and give people the option to get more extensions per match if they post about bumble to their Facebook walls.  Another thing, a person's profile is mostly just pictures because you give too few characters for a person to write about themselves (Tinder has you beat there)... And don't think about responding with some generic response, telling me that my opinion is appreciated... How about instead of telling me what I would like to hear, you stop wasting both of our precious time, and MAKE THE APP BETTER."
Brandi Brown,"Omg, the best looking worthwhile men in the area. And best feature...no inbox full of pervy catfish. Deleting my tinder, pof, and meetmindful accts today"
Garçon Voûte,"ABSOLUTE RIP OFF, 4 MONTHS IN SPENT 60 DOLLARS, NO MATCHES, I GET ATLEAST 3 A WEEK ON TINDER, YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM MY UNCLE. I MEAN MY LAWYERS, I'VE PAID FOR AND RECIEVED NO SERVICES, JUST BROKEN PROMISES AND BREECHED CONTRACTS, AGAIN YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM MY LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE."
A Google user,It would be better if you could select two options like man and BBF. The bonus you pay for doesn't work. Zillions of match on Tinder but nothing on this site? It's slow. Don't bother
Carlin Gibson,BORING APP MEN HAVE TO WAIT FOR WOMEN TO START CONVO. TINDER IS BETTER.
Arturs Android,"Seems like a better crowd than tinder, in Berlin at least."
A Google user,"I use the free version and don't appreciate the adds that pop up in your way but I like this app way more than tinder! More honest on how women choose men and maybe self selecting with who is on the app, but I see more relevant matches for myself."
Kevin Douglas,People take it more seriously than Tinder.
Matt Hayes,"Girls seem hotter on average, but tinder has more quality matches."
Kilo Graham,"Cons to tinder: you can't limit the distance someone else is away from you. (matched with someone who was 300km away). If traveling you can't swipe ahead of time. The girl has to talk first... And only has 24 hours unless you pay them for more time (that's tacky). No super likes, less options for being anonymous, less options in general.  Pros: less junk, generally better people I think but they don't respond well or quickly because they don't use it often... Cause it's a crappy app."
Brett Sharer,"Good app, like tinder but way less thots and bots."
Lisa Datta,Very similar to Tinder except that it forces you to respond to matches or lose them. This is a good thing. Only people who are really interested respond and the rest disappear as they should.
A Google user,"Slightly better than tinder kind of!! There seriously needs to be a penalty against all the stupid hoze that are on there for attention and never message you. I'd say 7 out of 10 matches don't message you, or message you saying ""hey"" and that's it. There needs to be a penalty, like them getting a lower rating to make them go to the bottom of the pile of swipes."
A Google user,ALWAYS out of matches. How is that possible? You act like only 19 people sign up for this app. Deleted and going to tinder now.
Dave Johnson,Not many users in my area.  And to upgrade is way too expensive.  Over 3 times the cost of Tinder.  Avoid this app and stick with Tinder
Jonathan Hurrell,Just seems fake because it's all mainly hot woman. What's the chances of that.... And can't get no response like I can on tinder. Really sucks. Should have a paid subscription to where we can message them if they don't respond to the match
Nathan Smith,Matches are a dime a dozen after the honeymoon period. Many experience the same...just look at online reviews...and it was so promising at first. I'll stick to Tinder.
A Google user,"I kind of like that the women have to initiate the conversation - takes the pressure off the guys for once.  That said, Tinder may suck, but at least you get a free ""super like"" every day. Bumble is pay-only. :("
Nicholas Moreno,Guys never respond on here. Then you only have 24 hours to respond...  tinder is better.
A Google user,"Well alot of fake profiles on this App. The customer service responces are generic and the same answers each time. It would seem the customer service reps have just 3 choices when responding to complaints. It's copy and paste , mostly answer one a pathetic apology. I am sure they don't even read the complaints, issues or problems you have. After they get your $$ , the customer service is no longer an issue for them. It's too bad for you sucker !! We got paid and if u don't like it too bad. How many refunds are given. None as refunds are not our business model. Not many success stories for the customer. Only success is the bank account of the App owner. Use Pof or tinder. You have the same chances without wasting your time or money. Same spam accounts on all 3 sites and only 1 takes your $$.  What automated reply will I receive? The same word for word reply as all the previous answers from bumble auto responce computer system. Swipe left for this App."
Mat Jones,"way, way better than tinder. people on this app actually want to talk, not just screw around, so you'll actually talk to people. I also find that the quality of the matching algorithm on this app tends to be a lot better"
Braden Roberts,"Much better than Tinder. Having the girl send the first message means you're less likely to be wasting your time in my opinion. Only thing they should change is giving 1 free superlike a day like tinder does. Otherwise second to none, IMO."
Andrew Brenner,"Bought a week of premium to see what girls swiped right on me. Turns out none did. I'm not ugly and I have a pretty standard profile. Waste of money. Girls on this app frequently fail to respond or are totally arrogant. Absolute waste of time app. I can swipe right on hundreds of girls and not get a match, so I will blame this on the matching algorithm​.  I have virtually the same profile on tinder and I get way more matches on there."
Matt Malmsteen,Get a bunch of matches and none initiate conversation. Starting to think all profiles are bots and you are trying to trick guys into spending money to extend match.  Tinder is better.
Bec Wilson,"I prefer it to tinder because at least the inactive profiles or people that aren't interested disappear in 24 hours and the men seem more genuine. I do wish it would show some kind of active rating though - either a lot of guys just say yes to everyone or are not very active, so I find the response rate lower than expected."
Nicholas Staffaroni,"I dunno if you want me to pay or what but i havent gotten a single match while on tinder ive gotten ~20 in the same amount of time. The system of being messaged first would be appreciated if: A) i had a single match to go off of B) if that wasnt already happening on tinder. Come on bumble get it together, i aint that ugly."
A Google user,Bettee than Tinder
Steven Sylvain,"I like it better than Tinder, but at least 2/3 of my matches never end up contacting me. I like that women are responsible for making the first contact, as I have heard the horror stories of mens' behavior on other dating Apps/Sites. I just find it frustrating​ that I never hear from more than half of my matches."
Jeffrey Schon,It's better than Tinder.
Stephen Kunkel,"I'm fine with app, it's better in quality than Tinder. In my opinion, the only thing bugging me at the moment is when receiving messages there is no noise, you have to check your phone to see if you have any."
Andrew Wolf,Better quality selection than tinder.
Anastasia Quinn,Better then tinder.
aaron bryant,Tinder works better
Adam Ratzlaff,Better than tinder
Lionel J,Took all things which were annoying with Tinder and fixed them.
Emilio Rodriguez,"No point in using the app if you can't even talk to your matches, tinder way better. Disappointing"
Peter Jones,"Bumble just lost all matches and forgot who I'd swiped on. Has the same pathetic Android programming as Tinder : doesn't support landscape mode, fails to lay out items properly, falls over. Then there's the design flaws, the same as Tinder : uses your current location to match, pointless if you're only visiting overnight or are regularly going somewhere that's already as far as you'd comfortably like to date. There's no detail on items such as children, smokers. relationship goals.."
Will Barnard,"Seems to be kind of the same as Tinder. Took a gamble and paid for a week of, I honestly forget what y'all call it, the +version to see matches the app said I have... Didn't work. Not much space in the way of a profile so finding shared interests is difficult. Kind of like the idea behind ladies being the first to make a move, but I don't think men should be disregarded. Lots of people have ""send me a message"" on their profile... But there's no way to do that."
Kyle Reysen,"Neat idea I guess but don't bother if you aren't very active on Facebook. Their algorithms work the same way as tinder, the amount of other people who see your profile is directly related to your Facebook activity. The goddamn thing doesn't push notifications or even buzz my phone on the very rare occasions that someone does match with me. Then they don't say anything. So it's a neat idea I guess."
Logan Richardson,"Way, WAY too many fakes. So obvious because literally everyone on here are smoking hot women.  Then take tinder, you get a good mix, that's how you can tell.  Get rid of the fake accounts then it'll be better."
Sylvain Wear,Less time wasters than tinder 10/10
John Rigano,If you are paying for a subscription you should be given some super likes included.  Gouging us extra for them on top of our subscription is not right. Tinder doesn't charge you extra and gives you 5/day.
Casey Reeve,I don't understand the super swipe.. other than that it does weed out the more of the fake profiles tinder gets. Ages 25-35
Shane Wynn,Better than tinder
Jane Dough,Seems to be a step up from Tinder
Moussa Hachem,Pointless. It won't match you with the people that liked you until you upgrade and pay them. It's almost like forcing you. No thanks. I'll stick to tinder
James Anderson,"Decent,  although less popular than tinder, there are less fakes and better people"
Dominic Pierce,It's fun and a lot better then Tinder!
Tomas Edwards,"Lots of fakes. 1 match who didn't respond and otherwise nothing at all.  Had much more interaction on POF and Tinder in a shorter space of time. Don't waste your time with this app, really disappointing."
Tom Osborne,Much better than tinder.
Maxi Canales,They make girls pay a subscription see the same losers the you found in Tinder. Paying for subscription for meet guys? I'm sorry but you have to be very desperate.
Alex Cary,"Not bad at all, the only dating site or app to encourage women to make the first move. Tinder, pof and all those other apps are either dead or the majority of people are spam. The only thing would be to make it 100% free but they dont ask for much, only if you want to see who has visited or liked your profile before you. I'll keep using this app and delete all others!  Good stuff bumble crew.  Alex"
Jemma Oliver,You have to constantly refresh you mile radius to get matches to come through. Should be mandatory fields for profiles or it just becomes another Tinder!
A Google user,"Prettier girls and easy to use, just started so hopefully it will be more useful at actually meeting decent folks than Tinder...."
Grant Musgrave,A complete waste of time. Get lots of matches but since its ladies first there is never any message sent. Dont install this worthless app. Stick to tinder or PoF
Animelover 212,"No different from tinder. It's just a better name to say ""I F@$k someone off Bumble"" instead of saying ""I F@$K someone from tinder"" don't waste your time if your really looking for a serious relationship."
Brittani R.,"The app is Good, just wish some of the guys weren't like tinder jerks. I kind of wish we could give the guys and extension but hey, their loss!"
Erum Alvi,You will still get tinder intention and behavior because the look is similar
Whitney Barker,"It's a pretty interesting little app. Definitely got some upsides to Tinder. I like that there's a time limit on your first little chat, cause otherwise I'd forget really quickly who I was talking to and why."
Shane Farrier,"If you are a guy who hates how few contacts he makes on Tinder, this is not the app for you. Even if you get a match there is less than a 10% chance anything will come of it, so you are going to have less than 10% of the activity you get on Tinder. Skip it."
Em Marie,"Would be better if people actually talked. Never thought I'd miss the thirst on tinder, but at least there was interaction"
Brandon Hoplin,Beats the heck outta tinder!
Sean Botha,"Can't set location, keep matching with people over 1000kms away. A bit pointless really. Prefer Tinder."
DanteSolvaris,"Seems to have higher quality women than Tinder, but no one I've matched has talked to me, even after I extended their time. Do I have to pay for a membership to get this thing to work?"
yndia barrows,"Much better than tinder. Kinda sucks if you match with someone and they onto answer if they haven't been on their account in a day and you lose them Also the backtrack feature messes up. Twice I've tried it and it takes me to someone from like 2 swipes back, not the previous one I wanted to check again"
Caitlin Aber,I like it a lot more than I like tinder
Aaron Gievers,Like a more family friendly tinder th
Matthew Spears,Why can't profiles be encouraged?  Yes I know you come from Tinder but even a short profile gives something more than one photo
Kathleen Hayes,Too much like Tinder. I want to know more about prospective dates than what they look like.
Adrian Lewis,Hobart is a shallow pool All the same people as tinder and pof.  We are a bunch of tragics
Isaac J,"The app is easy to use and offers a lot of options to improve your experience further. The main problem I have with it is that it doesn't seem to have a way to get rid of old profiles that weren't deactivated. I know of one friend that has been inactive for over a year and I still saw her profile when I installed the app recently. That would seem to mean you're wading through a sea of inactive users, and anyone out there that might like your profile will be doing the same. The latter problem is fixed by a paid service that lets you go to the front of the line for certain people (like Tinder's superlike, but you don't get any freebies), but that doesn't take care of the former problem.   The developers do seem to care and they might fix this issue in the future,  but for right now it's a pretty significant drag on the app."
Stephan JB,"Have to be on Facebook to join, wouldnt upload any of my photos that i used on Tinder for some reason & keeps pestering you with purchasing extras :-/  Get out & meet people in real life, cause this app is a waste of life"
שולם עליכם,Better app than tinder as it forces the female to initiate.  Also i think they may have a better algorithm for setting up appropriate matches.
Brendon Ortiz,Haven't gotten a single hit or conversation started. Tinder and POF are way better
Richard Papallo,Nobody talks and constantly be shilled to buy superswipe make tinder seem polished by comparison.
k24z3 cu10,Fake profiles not worth your time guys stick to pof or tinder . Seriously
Glenn Jones,"Can't even view messages if you're a guy, like you can on Tinder. Can't even see girls who picked you, unless you pay smdh!"
Addie O,"The guys on here are all really cute and respectful. The app itself is kinda slow, but still way better than Tinder."
jeremy young,"Bumble, if it can work out some glitches, will emerge as a premier dating app.  While Tinder Match and Plenty of Freaks are riddled with bots and have unscrupulous financial practices, and there's that geriatric douche rag with shitHarmony, Bumble is leaving the onus on women to make first contact.  It's actually an ingenious move.  However, 6 pictures and a paragraph is keeping it from enjoying much more success than it already has.  I would have given it 5 stars because I actually met someone on here and it seems to be going quite well so far.  But, I did have to take off a star for some shortcomings.  It'll be interesting to see how the app advances as time goes on.  For the moment, I don't have any problems heaping some praise on its creators"
Muzi Comic,"Save your time, save your money. Just use Tinder."
Alexander Ewing,"It's ok just got this and Tinder to pass the time, I like women go first bit but the constant you want this have to pay bit is becoming tiring verry fast.... Your not cheap also I think would be cheaper joining dating site and not this if was so inclined."
bernadette t silva,Same as tinder but with a little more control over messages
A Google user,"I admittedly haven't tried a TON of dating apps, but between this and Tinder, Bumble ABSOLUTELY takes the top spot. It may be purely coincidental, but it truly seems the women on this app are of an all-around higher caliber. The proportion of my matches that have actually resulted in great conversation and potential is significantly greater than that of Tinder.   My only complaint is the character limit on the bios. I'm sure most people only care about the pictures, but for people like myself who care more about what a woman has TO SAY than what she looks like, the short profiles are a bummer!"
Brooks Neely,"I really like the app, the quality of women is soooo much better than Tinder!  I live in a remote area though, so I wish I could change location or increase my search radius."
Michael Wysienski,"Great concept.  Locations are not as messed up as tinder but still get lots of ppl who clearly don't live anywhere near my part of the country.  Makes me wonder where my profile shows up, if at all."
Evan,It's like tinder for classy girls who won't give me the time of day.
John Matthews,"Way too expensive, very limited but better than Tinder."
Studio 11,"Well, I liked it at first but you run out of matches and then you find the same matches on Tinder. I think people want to make it a hookup site till they go to Tinder and at least communicate faster thinking they're going to hookup. I would've like to meet someone interested in getting to know people more than just a hookup. Oh well I tried..."
K Jackson,"Funner than Tinder. That's right. I said, funner."
Pat Ryan,Very good app. Better than tinder. More women with class on this site.
miked99,"There's no-one on here compared to other apps like Tinder, okc etc. Also strongly suspect there are a lot of fake profiles. When you open up the app and every other woman looks like a professional model then that's a massive red flag. It's a nice idea but a site that relies on women making the first move when women hate making the first move isn't going to work out in the long run. Shame."
A Google user,You get girls and then Bumble stops all communication between you and the girls that chose you. It's evil and wrong! I recommend using Tinder. It actually works. Fix your broken  system Bumble!
Blue Frog,No way to sign in without facebook.  If I had facebook I'd use Tinder.  Just let us sign in! Why do you need a facebook?
Mahue Wi,Why do you have to sign up with Facebook? I stopped my FB page for a reason and not going back. It may be popular but not everyone has it😑 Tinder use to be like this until they started a log in with your number.
A Google user,It's OK if you probably live in Chicago or LA NY with bigger populations so on I only got one match on this app and that person didn't even bother messaging after a extended 24 hours while I go on tinder and have a good amount of matches
Christopher Disney,Think the women make the first move mechanic is cool but other then that not much different then tinder
Shiv Patel,lot more to the point than tinder
A Google user,Way better than tinder lol
A Google user,UI is leagues better than Tinder. The whole swipe premise for matching is still cancerous and the worst thing to ever happen to internet meeting.
Anthony Edwards,Better than Tinder
Adam Cason,"I like that matching is easy, and there are less tinder quality fake or troll profiles. Pay to play features in apps need to take a dive however."
BECHIKH NAOUFEL,Same concept of Tinder
Race Chapman,Just saying I loved it in case it affects my ranking. Really the app sucks and i get wayyyyy more matches on tinder
Steven R,"Meh. Feels data heavy. When reception is good but not great, viewing profiles or swiping is slow. Hive loading page with every swipe. Problems you see with flash based sites. With same reception there is no slow down on Tinder or POF. Also the idea or letting women be the first to message is a nice approach but doesn't seem to be one that works. You end up matching with quite a few but seems they didn't get the memo the man can't make the first move. I would suggest allowing men to send 1 message to their match and only 1 to start things off. And if the match does not reply within 48 hours the match is then removed."
Jack freeman,Great app. Better than others I think. Beats tinder for sure.
Rick Tonetta,"Not bad, not great. Better than Tinder."
Derek Steinke,"I love the concept and the user base is overall pretty good, but I have some issues:  1. Please stop this heart icon from bouncing on the super swipe.  2. Please know I will literally never purchase one, at least until we get a free one or day like Tinder.  3. The ""Backtrack"" feature does not work properly on Android. When I use it, it pulls back some random person I've swiped left on instead of giving me back the most recent person I swiped left on. This has been going on for MONTHS. Please fix this.  Outside of this stuff, the app is pretty good."
Bridget Wyckoff,It's like Tinder but not terrible!!!
A Google user,"Really bad app, it won't let you upload other pictures, you are better off in tinder"
Miguel Roncal,"Better quality people than Tinder but waiting 24 for women who never have to open to well... open? Yeah, no. Extend time or give free super likes or something."
Dean Schuetze,Lots more real people than tinder.
Matthew Derr,Nobody talks. Its already becoming like Tinder. Nobody uses it. The whole 24 hours thing is BS.
Nathan McLaughlin,Prefer it to tinder
og phill,"No one waste your time or money on this app. I bought the bumble boost pack. Been swiping no stop not one message and match I got. This dating app is by far the worst one I have ever came across. If your really looking for new People to meet or date. Use tinder,match or any other ones. Biggest waste of 10.45 dollors."
Laura Weeks,"Like the idea, unfortunately a few pictures and a quick bio doesnt really mean you can weed out all the weirdos - wish they didnt allow pictures to be sent through the messenger in the app - at least with tinder a guys got to get me to give him my number before sending me a d*** pic"
Cinthia Rodriguez,"Recently decided to use the boost subscription. I like knowing who swiped right on me before I do.  Quality of people is waaaay better than tinder.    Things I don't like: backtrack doesn't always give me the person who was last (there goes the love of my life,  forever gone). My location has taken me to places I haven't been. On the settings (ever since I started the paid subscription) the mileage ratio changes almost every day. Really annoying. The super like feature is a great idea BUT not even a for free one?    Overall good app.    Still singleAF but Bumble,  it's me not you."
narsim naidu,Better then tinder but seems like alot of inactive profiles
Virginia Ramey,Better than Tinder. A well kept secret for those looking for more than hookups!
Andrew,"Another app demanding unnecessary permissions (like your phone logs and contacts), risking or outright selling private information. The only one it technically needs is storage (for additional features it could use the camera and location). Unjustifiably requires a facebook account. (at least their Facebook permissions are reasonable... not that it matters since they have all your phone permissions, I would suggest disabling them). On the other hand it does have a decent photo validation process... though it isn't enforced and still doesn't prevent things like cheek biting, hiding behind friends, and excessive exposure. Sometimes ""delete account is missing""(send an email). But to fully remove your account: 1. delete your photos and turn off public profile. 2. delete the app. 3. remove Facebook permissions. Moving on, their customer service is terribly slow (often over a week), and they don't even have decent explanations of all functions/features. It's basically tinder (more of the same) only you don't have the option to select your location. You have to use location services, which creates a safety risk and many inconveniences for people who travel a lot. Search will at times say there is no one, when you know there are more (like when you expand the range to include a big city). The blurry ""matches outside your range"" that you get seem to be a bogus (and illegal) marketing tactic to push paid membership, as they disappear in seconds.  The biggest functional issue is that people who have been on for a while (most users) won't be checking as often (if at all). So your most likely chance for a match is with people who join after you. Meaning the only people with a solid likelihood of finding someone, are those who joined first.  Other annoyances: Most women (and likely men) don't bother with any bio. The 24 hour time limit encourages women to stop at the first few matches. (Does the rule also mean gay men can't use the app?). The undo function picks a random previous person not the most recent. You can't see when someone was last online. The distance cap is a little short for the prairies (and you can't tell where they are based, just where they are). Standard dating site/app concerns like, ""more males use the app, so you actually have a worse chance of finding someone (than IRL) if you aren't in the top 5%"" If it isn't already a thing, past matches, that have timed out, should recirculate after a while (perhaps more often if you/they pay). Moreover, If they don't want to be a hook-up app they should prevent low km (below 15) filtering. It would improve engagement as well. If you are going to use it: -Women, you would be best off initiating conversation immediately, then continuing matching. If they go out of the area, then the conversation should remain. - Everyone, to maximize matches go through all the profiles in one sitting (may take several hours) then check back regularly for new people. -Everyone, remember that while 100km looks like a lot, it is only around an hour away. -Everyone, use at least 3 pictures where your face is clearly visible from different angles, and try to include some photos that give an impression of you, if you don't want to do a bio. (perhaps acivities/things you like, pets). -Everyone: Don't list your place of work.  As an aside, choosing 'bumbling' as a verb to describe using the app, is ill advised. Either it sounds like using your app is bumbling around uselessly, or that users are themselves bumbling. The alternative used occasionally is 'play'   which makes it seem as if matching game not to be taken seriously (which neither they, nor users would want). Alternatives like 'keep matching', 'swiping' or  'searching' might be better.  Ultimately, a better use of your time better, and greater odds of success would be asking out random people you encounter on the street. Go old school and give it a try. Try a cute wave, or smile at someone (if you can't introduce yourself, or compliment them). Guys don't do it these days lest they be accused of being creepy, so it is up to you ladies."
Divine Haunted,No spammers and fake accounts unlike tinder
Bicep 123,"Should get one free superlike a day, same as tinder. Also too easy for girls to unmatch during the 24 hour period. If you use your daily extend the girl shouldn't be able to unmatch until extend time is over or the guy just ends up wasting his daily extend. Sucks if he's matched to 2 at the same time and had to choose one. Ended up with the wrong one."
"Conrad H. Appel, IV","The app itself is really well designed and runs a lot better than competitors. The problem is, I'm pretty sure either no one uses it or all the profiles are fake. I don't think I've gotten a single match (who wasn't a friend in real life). I have the same exact profile on Tinder but I actually get some matches on Tinder. I've had this app for a while and I'm not necessarily an unattractive person so it's hard to rate this app highly."
Alex A,"I constantly have to restart the app and then it freezes again on the next profile. It's an interesting concept, but still Tinder is much easier to use"
David Clark,Layout okay. Overall just use Tinder
Daniel moreno,You are becoming tinder... Thanks for nothing
Zac Dredge,"Lacks any real substance. I was thinking that an app where women initiate contact would help weed out sleazy guys and allow the rest of us to communicate more freely. Unfortunately this is essentially a Tinder copy with a gimmick added on.  Have found it ineffective, honestly; I think the system is too restrictive with time limits etc."
Nathan Vines,"Decent app, definitely fixes some of the issues that i have with Tinder. Have had good chats with a few people over the last couple of days. 4 stars.  Bearing in mind that i like enjoy this app. My favourite thing so far would have to be reading all the reviews from guys complaining about women not chatting to them, and them blaming it on the app. P.S.A for those people: it's probably because you're a misogynistic loser, bad person or just lame. *mic drop*."
Kanaya Maryam,"New super tokens are way too expensive. WAY too expensive. I thought they'd do something like Tinder where you get one a day, but $2 for one... That's absurd. Hopefully the devs read this, because I would like to address the abundance of inactive accounts. Could you please add something that shows when someone was last active?  Pretty ok app. Could use more controls. It'd be nice if you could see when someone was last online. I also haven't had much luck at all, could be I'm not doing something right, but I feel like there's a lack of options that would allow me to increase visibility. Also I keep getting women who swipe right on me, but disappear a couple hours later. I like the concept, but I feel like it could be better."
Bernard Debotte,"When the app first got popular it was great. I would get regular matches and even found a girl on bumble before splitting after 3 months. Now Ive come back there are clearly a lot of inactive profiles as I can spend hours swiping and get nothing. Thats a massive issue as it makes the app a big waste of time. I would rather run out of people to swipe than swipe through people that arent using the app. That said, the usability of the app is better than tinder. In particular the fact that you can view a person's entire profile by swiping up and down without having to enter another window. But it falls down again with this new update because you have to pay for a super like. In my opinion thats taking advantage too much and I find it a little bit vulgar as a concept. At the end of the day we are all just trying to find someone and that should be the apps main priority rather than downloads and in app purchases. If you do the former the latter will come and your app will have more longevity rather than be a fad alternative to tinder."
A Google user,"Definitely better than tinder. The app is really slick and it's so nice not to have to judge whether the person is a bot. Edit: The devs definitely read your comments so if you have a problem, let them know on the feedback section inside the app. Changing my rating to 5 stars, thanks guys."
Pierre Philippe,No girls ever message....its pointless.  Get more hits off Tinder or POF.
Alex Karwowska,"It's just like Tinder, but more work. Not good for an actual dating experience. But to be fair, that might just be the people in my area. Here's a suggestion: make a setting in the app to choose what you're interested in (relationship, hook up, friendship, etc.)."
Sarah Schreiber,Bubble gets hotter chicks than Tinder
A Google user,Better than tinder
JaYaR Truth,Too many profiles seem fake. Heard that the algorithm puts the most popular people first which does not benefit the majority of people.  Very low amount of matches on here where as on Tinder I get almost too many. Love the idea where women message first though.
Chelsea Craig,This is so much better than tinder
Leonard Treman,It works better than tinder
Thane Smith,"Edit: At least you guys are diligent and obviously reading and replying to the good and the bad feed back! Right on 3 stars now ;) maybe I'll give you 4 or 5 when I can actually sign up. Guarantee this app with be bombs with a bit more work..please make a phone verification.  I have to sign up with Facebook? What a joke, I don't even have Facebook. Facebook is over rated and full of bs. Why not allow me to register with my phone number like tinder does?..Cool concept allowing women to choose who they want to message instead of getting creeped on but from other comments and the issue I just mentioned, you ladies and gentlemen have some work to do."
Andra Constandache,Classier than tinder
Alex Diamandas,"People will show up more than once despite you having swiped already. This cannot be due to them recreating their profile because it has happened dozens of times for a single profile. Very strange. Otherwise, no different than tinder."
Cameron McCullough,It's like tinder but much better
Ben Marengo,Much better ui than tinder
pablo zapata,"I've had this app for almost 2 months, I've had only three matches.... THREE. At least with tinder I can get maybe one or two matches in a few days."
Jeremy Wagner-Kaiser,The app is ok. It performs well and does more or less what it promises. Its main failing is that it doesn't clearly communicate to many of its users that the rules are different from on Tinder.
Donald Stewart,"Online dating is terribly flawed. Period. That being said, bumble works for what it is and certainly has less spam than tinder. One glaring problem is that men tend to initiate contact in dating situations, so... How's that going to work?"
Derick Anderson,less spam and easier to use than Tinder
Tysen Imai-Toyama,I get 1 match compared to every 12 matches on tinder. I guess I'm not attractive enough.
A Google user,Way better than Tinder. Much more professional. Much easier to use. Nicer app.
Kit Palencar,"Honestly, this is a little more professional than tinder"
Brandon Manusov,Works better then tinder
Mercury Retrograde,Heh.  Grown up version of tinder. Why call it a dating app when most the dudes are just looking to hook up? I also don't like that I can't see guys from home when I travel.  I only see guys local to my current location... which encourages hook ups.
kurt Bader,I like the concept of girls having to make the first move but should have a button like tinder where u can super like the girl if you really find her atttactive or give the guy a one a day thinh where they can make the first move or something
Karl Warner,"Works, infinite swipes, better then tinder"
duglis bagley,Better than Tinder
A Google user,"No Matches Ever, and you have to pay to super like? Will stick to tinder."
Logan Duke-Bodnarchuk,Bumble &gt; Tinder
Scott Mason,I've had more luck with Tinder. I sometimes wonder if my likes are going through.
michael whittier,Not as good as tinder
Derek Herley,Way better than tinder.
Matthew Collinson,"Interface better than Tinder. Problem is that girls match and still don't talk even though the whole concept is ""girls have to talk first"" but that's not the apps fault."
Alex Leonard,Way hotter girls than tinder.
A Google user,Messaging isn't perfect but the app itself is favorable over tinder so it's a good one in my book.
April E.,"So far, I like the user interface; it's a lot like Tinder with the swiping and matching system, easy to use. However, I haven't had much luck at all, perhaps because I am a woman seeking other women, so it might just not be as gay-friendly. Or I'm ugly. Maybe both. I am curious about unlocking who has already swipes 'yes' to me but I think that feature is pretty pricey and I don't want to commit to 6 months of that feature if I decide I don't like the app later on."
Mark M,"Doesn't bug out, seems a bit more classy than Tinder but also along the sames lines of it. It's decent."
Xana Still,"Superswipe should not be a premium feature because its hard to get attention. Theres something wrong with the app, only 1 match so far after a week of swiping, Tinder gives me constant matches. Either let us superswipe so we get ppls attention or fix the bug that doesn't register us swiping right correctly."
Jordan Shelton,Finally far better than Tinder!
A Google user,"Not what I was expecting,  almost like Tinder"
Emily Nelson,As a female I'm always the first to message even on tinder so this is literally no different. Can you explore having a way to weed out those who just want NSA fun and those who intend to use this for actual dating?
Will Whitmore,Since the July 1st 2017 update it's been glitchy. It keeps telling me no connection but other apps are working. A lot more quality woman than other apps and this year I came back because more women on the app vs last year. Please don't turn into tinder or fish
A Google user,It's a good alternative to Tinder.
Matthew Bea,"Not sure why people are whining, this apps concept is pro!  I like how the ladies have to message me first, makes it easier to play hard to get... Its a good replacement for tinder which is dead RIP"
ayhan umar,Much better than tinder
david watson,"*updated*  My original post is listed below this update. I have received many more matches lately since my first post but have also identified many fake or seriously inactive profiles. When a member has listed there are in a city close to me but there actual facebook shows them in Texas or another state living in that state, that shows some issues.  So, my first review was deleted. I started by doing it right and reading every profile and looking at every picture. I received no responses. I then did the ""tinder method,"" and swiped right on everyone. I would estimate over 1000 right swiped with around 7 responses. That is less than .7% response. Horrible statistics. This is a great concept but inactive profiles need to be removed and ""fake"" profiles need to be removed."
Jessica,Long story short: bumble has turned into tinder where guys are looking for a quick hookup or an ego boost. Please change the ability for people to be able to see my exact location. It's discomforting not to mention creepy to have someone knowing where I am all the time.
Travis Ahrens,Pretty good app. Seems better than Tinder
Jared Armstrong,"My profile isn't showing up to other users I've never got a match and have tried swiping everybody right, I get constant matches on tinder so I have no idea what is going on with this app"
Travis R,"I like the concept, the interface is much more user-friendly than Tinder. My only con are the low number of characters for bio and 24 hours to respond is too short."
Ivan White,"I hardly ever get a match, and whenever I do they never talk to me anyway. All dating apps are the same. It's really depressing. I'm a genuine guy looking to find a genuine girl, and I don't get out much. So I have to use Bumble, Tinder, POF. They are all terrible. I'm at my absolute wits end at this stage. It's been going on far too long."
Danielle Smith,It's like tinder for bff. I love it. Met my friend here.
A Google user,"Even when you pay extra, it's only for a few names. No different than Tinder."
Martin Lambert,"This new payment system has turned it in to Tinder. This is why I chose to use Bumble instead. I'll go find something else again, now."
Anthony D'Orazio,Better than tinder
Tyler Worwa,Better than tinder
Ben Cady,"Love it so far, way better than tinder. Girls really have the power position so its nice to switch it up. Layout is really smooth and ive only met nice people, dates and friends included!"
Zane Lundgren,"Better than tinder, but smaller community and the app kills my battery."
Joseph,"Barely any matches ever,  even with multiple restarts.  Yet on tinder I am getting a few every week.  Good app design and set up,  but seems to lack the base it needs"
A Google user,It's like a classier Tinder.
Nikki Bellofiore,"I'm sick of this 'our busy bee's will assist' bullsh!t. When will bumble address the issues that come up over and over? I have been having issues similar to other user's for years. The backtrack doesn't work (that's gone ignored for month's by the 'busy bees'), I've had TWO matches in month's (bumble blame my picture quality! They seem to be OK for tinder?) and I get no responses to messages - LOTS of ppl have said this (again, bumble assume the content of our messages are not engaging). Stop blaming the user and take responsibility for your poorly developed app. If it's not going to function effectively on android remove it from the play store until it's been fixed."
heath swearingin,"Overall better than tinder, like the option it gives ladies"
Emily Komiyama,"Definitely better than tinder. But push notifications don't work at all (which makes the 24 expiry thing a bit annoying, because I constantly feel the need to check if I have new matches/convos)."
Leon Harris,"Interesting concept and better quality pictures than Tinder, although most seem Instagram heavy and unnatural. Very little diversity, as all seem to be cherry-picked white woman, blonde, blue eyes, who have pet pugs, snowboard every year, ride horses and sit in expensive bars with their friends who look exactly the same.  For when I do find a match, it seems Bumbles execution of its core concept needs rethinking. From my experience 7/10 matches on Tinder results in a two way conversation or a date, in contrast to 7/10 matches on Bumble results in either a timeout or they just dont speak. Women for whatever reason still assume/expect a man to initiate chat, it's just how it is, but instead this tries to force a new way on people for no particularly good reason, which I have found doesn't really work anyway. More than once I have been 'rush' messaged by a match to get rid of the timer which ultimately puts the ball back in my court as well, so what's the point! Few women open with anything more than a 'hey' or 'hi' so again, what's the point? I'm sure some women are probably unaware they actually need to initiate conversation, so they just move on due to no response (I'm assuming). Either way it's a poor way to extort money from men in order to extend this timer thing through a paid feature.  I think it would be better to charge men if they want to chat first, this way they get the best of both worlds while filtering out the types of men that send nonsense to matches which appears to be an issue on Tinder (according to the warning profiles I have read)  Wouldn't really recommend simple due to the app providing many matches in equal number to Tinder, while unlike Tinder, few matches result in an actual conversation.  It's like people swipe right for the sake of it."
Sam Spitzer,Way better than Tinder or any other dating apps.
Temi Aridegbe,"Poor concept and very well deserving of 1 star. If I could give zero stars, I would do so in a heartbeat.  First, girls almost never message first. I'm sure you guys at Bumble HQ can easily pull up the profiles and read a majority of girls' profiles. They typically go along the lines of ""Message first or we'll never talk"". Why make an app dedicated to those who don't use it? It's beyond me.  Second, guys and gals alike this app is filled with fakes. You can have 20 matches, but zero messages. You can extend matches for the next year, but receive not one message. You can rematch 50 times, but still have an empty mailbox. My point? Waste of time and money.  Third, I was a fool to consider this app. Tinder is much in itself. But Bumble is by far one of the worst."
Wade Mathis,"Clunky, tinder seems to be more responsive"
lindsay Wray,Definitely better quality than tinder.
Jon Owens,"Seems to be packed with beautiful, intelligent women. And easy to get a first date with them. Perhaps these are the top shelf ladies scared off by Tinder?"
SMASH MONSTER,"Better than Tinder, no bots either"
wcm142,Good app better than tinder
Ryan Murray,So far I really like it. It seems to be better at finding local people than Tinder.
John Cole,Way better than tinder! I had both apps on my phone at one point but deleted tinder when I saw the quality of people on here and how you don't have to pay for unlimited swipes.  I also love that the women have to message first.
Shannon s,"This app is kinda lame compared to tinder. I get the whole women initiating the conversation first, but I just get so bored with always having to start a conversation! It would be nice if there was a feature like back track where for 2 or 3 people a day you could switch the convo over to them so they guys could start.   Speaking of back track, on my app it never goes back to the most recent person I swiped left on, but to three or four people back. Really frustrating!  And there needs to be a longer time window to reply. Most people do work and sleep you know! That does take up a majority of the day! If it was a 48 hour window it would make more sense and you would get the opportunity to talk to more people.  But I doubt anyone that works for this app will ever take anyone's ideas into consideration, because they have so many other great features they're working... I mean after all I've ALWAYS wanted to share the people who I've met on a dating app with my friends, family, and co-workers!"
Andrea Cesarek,Better than tinder but that's not saying much.
Jason Partridge,Just like tinder. No real girls here.
Bryan Pione,Lot more real conversations than Tinder. I really enjoy it!
Chester Hitz,Good concept and much less buggy than tinder
A Google user,Better than tinder.
Michelle Conn,This app is way better than tinder. I've found more luck on it than other sites. I love that women make the first move. Makes things less awkward!
Ronan Lee,It's grand for what it is. And you know what it is. Not that different from tinder.
Rocco Lapaire,Nice to not have to always start conversation.  Swiping interface is smoother than Tinder.
Nate Hadley,Conceptually I appreciate what this app is trying to achieve but it suffers from a number of fundamental issues in execution. I feel like the site wants to be more than a hook up app but all the changes made to change this from Tinder have really only added a minor barrier to discourage creepy dudes from soliciting sex in the first message. Now they have to reply with a creepy message instead. I also dislike the timeline to reply.
Daniel Baer,"The app is fun and easy to use. Its not sketchy like Tinder. It needs a lot of improvement. When you meet someone and delete the app your profile stays active. There are so many abandoned profiles. A lot of girls swipe right for everyone and when you match, they decide. So if you are guy, expect a lot of matches and no messages. I find it suspicious that 99% of the girls on here are very attractive and well dressed. I feel that half of them are fake. I've met a couple people out of about 1,000 swipes. Its fun, it works, but there are much easier ways to get a date"
Geoffrey Hanson,"Harder to get matches on here compared to tinder. I have to swipe constantly to get only a few matches, which may not even turn into a conversation. Though there is no limit to swipes and when you actually get a conversation going, it's usually bigger quality."
Christie LaBarca,Better than tinder great interesting concept ....
Michael Cossairt,Better than tinder. Wish more users were on it.
B B,"No way to control search params and specify what kind of people you're looking for in any kind of way at all. Its pretty much exactly the same as tinder with the safety of women message first, if you're not doing same gender searching."
Stephen S,"I ran a little test to determine the fakeness and/or massively high standards of both tinder and this app. I swiped right on EVERY SINGLE PICTURE, including some missing teeth and probably 200 pounds overweight. My profile picture was as average a guy as you could be. Nothing wrong, but nothing standing out. You tell me how good an app this is."
Chris McConnell,Y'all have to add room for longer bios. That's one thing Tinder has on Bumble.
Darcie Jacobson,"I love how easy it was to see peoples pictures right away. You just swipe up, and then you can swipe left or right. I prefer it to tinder because I don't have to actually tap their profile, go through pictures,  and then go back to swipe left or right. It's so easy!"
Dan Thurston,Much better for guys than tinder.
Matthew welch,Much better than tinder.
Jesse Wells,"I think bumble is the best format of the dating apps available. I know women can get inundated with messages on other apps. This one let's them have more control. It also has the simplicity of tinder, with better vewing capabilities."
calvin mwariama,"Loool you literally have to pay for matches xD Its like paying facebook for adding friends or twitter for following people. Apps like this and tinder are just there to make money, and could careless about user experience. They take features that should be free, and remove them, then ask you to pay for them, instead of offering better features for premium. This is just another stupid tinder clone thats there to take advantage of you all the way."
Nideo Vinja,"A flawed concept, women almost never message first. This app even offers a smaller profile character count than Tinder (also a terrible app), making it even more superficial. Do yourself a favor and try PoF or OkC and just message them first. Works like a charm."
A Google user,Okay gave this another try to see if anything improves since my last use. Nope. Matches results are not as good as tinder by a big margin. There's just no incentive to get matched here. Don't bother with this app. Get tinder or go out and meet people. It's easier than this mess.
A Google user,Far better than Tinder but still has the problem of matching but then no one responding to messages. I love the layout too.
Mychelle Dean,Better than Tinder although the back swipe function NEVER works and randomly returns me to someone I purposely swiped left on in the past 24 hours.
Erik Lambie,Nice competition to tinder
Amy Yvonne,Classy version of tinder
Kyle Androyna,Its like my profile is not being seen. I have swiped right on everyone for about a month now. Not a single match.  I might not be the best looking guy but I get matches on tinder so dont understand how Im going so many days with not a single match on this.
A Google user,works well and just stick with it as you get more interest the longer you stay with it.  keep changing your main photo and dont be negative in your description of your self. it isnt Tinder which to me is good.
B Oxenrider,No offense to bumble. I dislike Tinder as well. Dating apps just kind of suck when you're not a very good looking guy.
Sam Brannen,"It's a step up from tinder in my opinion. Bumble hasn't been overrun by spam accounts, thankfully."
Gabe Mesidor,"This app is definitely better made than tinder. It sucks that I don't get any matches though :/ but hey, that's life"
Colin Birkens,"Requires Facebook to work. Most other apps just require a phone number. ZERO STARS! Please fix and I may try, if not there's always tinder"
Ryan Rasor,Seems to work well. I matched way faster then Tinder
Tiffany F,"Backtrack, one of the more unique features of this app, doesn't work. It doesn't give me back the last person I swiped left, just a random one I've swiped left. This time, backtracks 1 and 3 gave me back the exact same person. It's the same profiles that are on tinder anyway, so why bother if the unique features don't actually function the way you assume?"
Ali Shannon,"It's astounding, way better than Tinder. I like the setup, it makes dating really simple"
Tony Orellana,"It's a great concept and the girls here are on average cuter than Tinder, the only problems are I match with fewer girls, and I do match, they never make the first move."
Jenny Laine,I get quite a few matches and I always try to send a somewhat witty or clever opening message....1/15 maybe responds. It's exhausting and not working any better than Tinder so far. Disappointed tbh.
Robsley Auguste,New to this....hoping this works. But I really don't want to go on Tinder! 🙏
Devin Wanberg,I feel like the fact that you can lose a match makes it a better dating app. More classy than tinder.
Zach Heise,App works for me.  Interface is better than tinder.  Took a star off for the obviously fake profiles you're subjected to in the beginning
Colby Frosch,Better than tinder.
emily lekas,"It's a nice change for women to be in control, and i find the percentage of people only looking for a hookup remarkably less than tinder. Which makes actually conversing with someone much more pleasant."
Beni Harper,Better UI than tinder and overall great experiences meeting people.
SLAYER one1,Havent had a single match not so much as a fake profile and here i was thinking tinder was shallow this takes it to another level
Camilo Santana,The app seems well-written and UI interaction better thought through than tinder. I think tinder is too much of a time-sink for me. I'm giving this a shot as a casual user. Let's see...
Ty,"Seemingly better than tinder so far...but still, just another app you need to pay to see who likes you...makes its another knock off of eharmony pretty much...how about free to see who likes you? Advertising should more than pay for the app like with everything else online..."
Kyle Vc,Just as shallow as tinder so if you are moderately attractive you will do fine. A guy like me however doesn't stand a chance.
Josh Patterson,Unlike Tinder a lot more of the user base is more wholesome and looking for something real
Zach Smith,"Overall, it works but not very well. Either the attractive women dont really use it or I'm butt ugly which I know I'm not. I only get matches from people that really aren't my cup of tea. The only reason is because I spam the hell out of it since this app didnt really work not too long ago and I deleted it then and I'm probably gonna delete it again. They really should update the profiles that are active vs inactive. This is common on tinder as well. You find a cute girl and see her attached insta and she has a bf. I'm gonna assume this is the same for bumble but not as obvious. Do something about the inactive profiles like removing them out of the pool of other profiles. It's adding to the ones that are ""fake"" and so on. It's so bad I'm getting to the point I'm just jot getting any matches even with spamming the hell out of it."
Virgile Bon,"Finally serious people, way better than tinder, girls choose, so you know it's more serious!"
snake42591,"Nothing but a ego boost for the ladies. At least tinder allows either or(always male cause females... Feminism???) to message. Just use tinder, more people anyways."
Matan Peleg,It's really fun and easy to use. The functionality is a bit better than tinder and the conversations are easier with the girl starting.
patricia gracia guerra,"The app itself is boring and a cheap copy of tinder. Then good luck if you decide to pay for premium service. I paid for one week and I didn't know they're taking payment from my card every week, even though I deleted my account. When I got in touch with their customer service they washed their hands and blame Google apps!!!"
Rahul Noronha,Kind of a dumb idea. Its like Wal-Mart Tinder.
C,"I can get matches and the ""ladies message first"" concept is good, but nobody actually messages first. Good concept turned stupid by people who don't use the app properly. Going back to tinder. Fly a kite, bumble."
Josh Halbauer,Better than tinder
Jimmy Johnstone,Tinder is a lot better.
Matthew Brower,"It was a great premise: Put the shoe on the other foot. Men are now the ones needing to be impressed, and the women have the opening line. It's a lot like going to a bar and having a woman walk up and say, ""What's a guy like you doing in a place like this?""  Plus, it actually makes it almost impossible for men to say anything weird. Now, women need to confirm their interest before a guy gets to say something weird. It's a nice safeguard, and it helps us guys not mess it up, and it helps women not get catcalled.  But the thing is, women realized pretty quick that they don't like the pressure of starting the conversation. They would just send ""hey"" and be done. They still want the guys to make the first move. Most still want to be pursued, not to pursue.  Which is why no one uses it anymore.  Now, believe me when I say: Don't trust reviews that say no one uses a dating app. There's a good chance that those reviewers are just salty. But take it from me: I've had a lot of matches on Tinder. Loads. I've had three matches in roughly the same time with Bumble, all of which didn't make it past the first stage of conversation.  So, does that mean the women on Bumble have higher standards? Maybe. It could also mean that only a handful of women actually still use it. Sure, there are a lot of profiles (though I ran out of profiles in my area once or twice), but I don't think that almost any are active, and I think I know why:  They don't like the pressure to impress their query. Funny how that works, lol.  On top of that, the super-liking function from Tinder is not here.  Which is a minor nit-pick, I know, but you need a way to make yourself stick from a crowd. A way to get their attention amongst their stack of likes.  But maybe I'm just unattractive. Although, judging from my past experience from Tinder, I don't think it's as likely of an explanation. I have thus deleted my Bumble account and uninstalled it. I wouldn't get this app, were I you, but it is a very enlightening commentary on what women want."
Bill Colson,Very nice better than Tinder
James Pier,While other apps like Tinder and OKC have severely downgraded in the quality of people.  Bumble has top models. Really beautiful.
Michelle Benz,Definitely more into bumble than tinder but it has a really annoying bug where if I'm in a conversation with someone and I send more than one message for some reason it automatically puts the last word of my last message as the first word of my next message. Super annoying.
Jason James,It's nice app unlike Tinder you're​ noticed of who likes you or at least given a blur of the person which is good. Con is not many people are active on the app so most matches are wasted at the end.
Tyson Guy,"The latest version is buggy as hell and despite having a paid account, support is non-existent! Been over a week since I reported matches and conversations disappearing.   Thought that maybe I got un-matched, but then I met one of the ladies on Tinder that showed me her phone with us matched up, her sending me messages and she's not on my list! I get notifications all the time ""reply to so&so to remain matched"" when we we'd been chatting back and forth all day! The app is just jacked and not worth the time, much less the $$$. 75% of my matches just vanish for no reason!   Yes, used the feedback button. Days later I got an automated form letter reply saying that they will investigate all bug reports.  Reddit and other online forums are full of people reporting the same bug - matches vanish."
Alex Wood,Much better than Tinder
Maddie Thein,"This app does everything you wish tinder did. And somehow everyone on here is beautiful. The girls have to message first so no more flooded inboxes of ""hey"" from guys, and you can look for just women or friends if you want. Great app."
Karl Broberg,So much better than tinder
Nick LaBelle,if tinder is uber then bumble is lyft
Max Aldana,Just better than tinder
JB,The app doesn't have nearly as many bots/glitches as Tinder. But it'd still be better if men could speak first as well.
Kale Yeah,This app is a fresh new look at the tinder style dating apps
Custom Cars USA,Make yr app where you can see who is near by online or in yr city also needs to make more connections when u like a person make it better than tinder make like match but better when you add swipe right you never get contacts please update make better contacting people able to swipe right to like or message yr app is more like tinder and that app is not good make moreime match please update
Michael Scarr,UI is waaaayyy better than tinder
justin holtz,It's tinder but girls talk to you first.
Brandon Compson,"Actually a pretty cool concept, I personally like it more than tinder to say the least"
Madison Murray,"About a month on this app, not even a single connection/message. Don't waste your time, the app's either dead or garbage.  No problems matching on tinder/pof, but was hoping to find someone a bit more, long term, then what you find there.   Back to pof ftl, its the only app that seems to work well."
Tom Duggan,"Some of the images seem to have a bad resolution, more than I would expect, recently got this phone, Moto g5 running android 7, so maybe it's something in my settings, but as an app it's great, like tinder but seems much more promising and a bit more fun; the chat dynamic seems to hold more potential than tinder also"
Dupree TheBoss,"literally the worst dating app for fuys. you'd think an app where girls have to message first would be awesome, but in reality I get even fewer matches on here than tinder (which is next to none), and when I do finally match with 1 person after months of swiping everyone in a 50 mile radius, my one match says nothing to me after 48 hours with the app constantly telling me NOT to make the first move. Maybe one day there will be a dating app for guys that girls actually use, but I doubt it."
Tania H,"Hetero F here. I like this app, a lot. Enjoyed all the dating (and BFF dates) I got from it - everyone seems more genuine / a better match for me than on Tinder. Just needs more people to use it!"
Kara Ladle,Much better than tinder!
Kirby Deedeedee,"I like it a lot more than tinder. Strangely enough, it showed me how women think the first message should be"
A Google user,1000x better than tinder. Unlimited likes and girls start the convo. What more could you ask for?!
Faiyaz Mohammad,"Really needs more users, and premium needs a feature like boost for tinder. Other than that, I like it a lot."
Reese Risden,"Different from Tinder, but good in its own ways."
AJ,Like it better than tinder. Easy to use and not as many fake profiles
Chris Corbell,Awesome app to meet people. Way better than tinder
Chan Hoang,"I like this app! Prefer it much more over Tinder. I get so annoyed matching on Tinder and then get an influx of messages. For a girl who is stepping back into the dating scene, this app's rules where I can make the first move is genius!"
Tyler Bardin,Better then tinder
Rob Feeny,"Far too many fake profiles. I got a few matches, but it's laughable, 9/10 profiles are of very beautiful women, there's no way it's real. Contrast it with Tinder, where 20% of the girls are a ""Yes"", on Bumble, 90% are a yes. My friends and I all played with it and basically it seems they've scraped the Instagram of a few thousand attractive women and created fake profiles...  I would have to report 2/3 profiles if I tried to report all the fakes. We all sat around laughing about it at a party. No city in the world has that high of a concentration of beautiful people."
Seth L,"The matching algorithm is the worst in the dating app game. Tinder with same photos, bio and people using it gets at least 5 matches a day, bumble 0 matches per day. The girls I like on bumble, I usually end up meeting through tinder because it seems to like me more... This app is a waste of time."
A Google user,"Better quality of men than Tinder. How ever, the notifications don't stay in my status bar, so I miss when I match with someone or get their messages. If im looking at my phone and they pop up, I can get it. I think may have lost quite a few connections because of that."
Chris,"seems dead, I've had a few matches, most of them expire before any messages are sent.  time limit is pretty lame, would never pay for it.  going back to Tinder."
Sierra Cole,"I try to download this app and my phone says it contains a virus. Tried the app after tech support assured me there is no virus. Better than Tinder. This app needs an  awful lot of permissions too. After update, android still warms me this app contains a virus."
Preston W,Worse than Tinder. Might be interesting if it didn't require a match.
Kris M,I don't have Facebook so instantly I can't use this app. Why would I need a social media app to use another social app? This is Tinder all over again. If you need to register a login I hear Google+ works great.
Holly Moley,So much better than tinder!
Anthony Nielsen,Still having a way better experience with Tinder. Seems to be more of a golden standard for mobile/online dating.
A Google user,Much better than tinder but accounts that have been inactive for more than a month should be removed from the matching pool
gabriel tessier,Tinder like but better
joseph carswell,"In my honest opinion Bumble has the hottest girls! Between Tinder, POF and Bumble this is the only review I've written. With unlimited likes and the hottest girls, how can you loose?"
Allison Arenaz,"I have spoken to and/or met a couple decent guys on the app. The rest have been dogs. I just LOVE how the app is marketed toward women as us having the first move, getting the pick of the litter... is there another, separate ad campaign for guys telling them to come pick out a ho? Bumble aka Tinder..."
Joe H,Lags badly. Tinder has more matches
Mitchell LeFebvre,"Great layout, girl messaging first is good so you don't waste as much time. Very few bots for now, unlike Tinder."
Davin Welch,"Warning,  this app contains a virus since the last update. Other users are having the same problem.  Don't download this unless it gets resolved.  Aside from that, the app is good, I notice almost no bots on this compared to tinder and I also get alot more matches that are close to me"
Meghann O'Malia,"Don't buy the subscription. It's garbage, doesn't give you priority or any extra perks. You still only get 24 hours to talk to people...some of us are extremely busy and don't have time to message people asap.  Found the people on it extremely flaky and with ridiculously unrealistic expectations. It's basically a higher-end version of Tinder. Also, they still charged me even though I deleted my account, and refused to refund me, giving me some lame, pathetic scripted response. Terrible customer service. Avoid this app!"
Miami Green,"No bad. Less shady than Tinder, cuter guys."
kyle schlebach,Not hacked like tinder. You actually can meet local people. Good app
Terel Colemon,A lot more talent on here then tinder
Brett,Great app. A lot better than Tinder.
David Balzer,Don't listen to the haters. The application is really good. Minor issues with notifications sometimes but far better conversations than in tinder since girls have to invest something at the start as well. Also to guys complaining of no matches - it's your profile. I had a match que of 50+ within a day. Work on yourself and your profile and stop complaining.
Devin Washington,I like that women have to be the first to start the conversation. Everyone seems a bit more classy than Tinder
karl benacci,Tons of fake profiles. It's pretty humorous when 90% of the women on this app are gorgeous yet on Tinder maybe 15% of them are even attractive. Getting a match on Bumble is next to impossible. There's no doubt in my mind most of these profiles are fake. Probably just another app trying to sell the data they collect to advertising and media companies. Don't even bother downloading this garbage waste of time app. So this means I'll have to meet people like a normal person... in real life.
Xerxes14 k,"Order of profiles is sketchy at best. I noticed as you begin, profiles are mixed with mostly attractive people BUT towards the end the profiles are all of less attractive folks.  I haven't gotten many likes so I can't help to wonder if for guys they do the same and my profile is left at the very end. PROFILES SHOULD BE MIXED RANDOMLY NOT PULL UP BY THE STANDARDS YOU GUYS HAVE CODED IN. finally, I know you want to be different from Tinder but you should have like /dislike buttons. All this swiping is starting to cause physical strain on fingers."
Aaron Wells-Wood,"It's pretty good, other than Noone talks on here. With tinder people actually talk"
cbuhl70,Better then tinder
David Gereau,"Great concept, just don't expect a single match if you're male.  After over a week of use got no matches, got 10 on Tinder in the same span of time."
CiKi,"No fake profiles! Which is great, unlike Stupid tinder. Should introduce super like feature like tinder."
Erin Oneill,It is just the like the early days of tinder but better!
Max,"Bumble created tons of profiles that USE beautiful women (who may or may not be real)as BAIT for men to market their app as ""Elite"". (The CEO believes SHE can do a better job than the tinder CEO because of their little fallout) HA!  (Men don't all of sudden become respectful because the interface changes)  It's becoming an elitist filter at best. This leads to lack of conversation.  When I get a matches on tinder I at least feel there is a possibility to converse with a human OR a bot! Lol At least it's a conversation!  IF I match on Bumble, the possibility of having a conversation is slim!   Tinder has bots BUT it also has an equal/more amount of good-looking people that actually have conversation.   Advice:  Don't emasculate men with this pseudo feminist app. Equality does NOT mean allowing women to control WHEN a conversation starts. It's apparent, with the lack of conversations on your app, that women cannot keep up with their matches and conversations. Give some equal leverage to both men and women."
Dustin,Nobody is ever on it. I get 10x mote matches on Tinder
Christian Corr,"This app is pretty good as far as less fake profiles than tinder. The one thing that absolutely never works is the ""Backtrack"", where it allows you three chances to go back. This flaw has been like this for the past year and I'm so surprised they still haven't fixed this"
Daphné Larivière,"Great app, useful, I would have given it 3 stars had it not been for them banning me for being ""underage"" when im not. Oh and they won't fix it either and ice sent them emails about it. 😊 so yeah I don't recommend it I'll just stick with tinder. K thanks bye ❤"
Daniel,"Tends to be fewer matches, but more dates. Same concept as Tinder without the bots and girls have to message you first. Definitely cuts down on the matches that never reply to you."
Kosta wasserman,"The best app, tinder Fd up 😋"
Michael Chan,Still filled with clearly fake profiles. All empty bios and everyone works at a modeling agency. Bumble will toss you a fake match every few months to pretend like you have a chance to get you to pay but she won't message you because their bots aren't as good as Tinder bots. They claim being linked to a Facebook profile means it must be real. My lunch has a Facebook profile. Wanna date my lunch? Get real.
A Google user,"The app is a scam....don't do it!!!! Don't give them access to your Facebook account.  They use your information for theft and fake  profiles.  Half of the profiles are fake to begin with.  If you use the pay option the app doesn't unlock the features you pay for but instead keeps your money.  You're better off with Tinder, Match, etc.  Walk away...you've been warned!!"
mike curtis,Boring.  Lack of active users just stick with tinder/pof you'll at least get a few hits there.
Bella Rossiter,"I was SO EXCITED to download bumble & delete Tinder having heard so much good about your app off a morning show. Turns out its obvious you just paid them to advertise you as your site is horrid!! I can not do a single thing unless I sign up to pay constantly!! What is the point of the app even being free then?! What the actual ladies? You've definitely lost me & I'll be telling every woman I meet & interact with how terrible this app is! DO NOT DOWNLOAD, ANYBODY!! Looking through here, you only have bad reviews. No idea why I bothered."
Jonny Childs,"Good app, no fake profiles and better than Tinder. Plus, the ladies message first? Nothing gets better than that"
Taylor Matthews,It's like a free Tinder (or what Tinder used to be) with some pretty creative twists! I've also noticed far less bot accounts here.
A Google user,"Smaller user base than Tinder and OKCupid, but high quality people."
John Cain,Better than POF or Tinder
Gracemaree Buerklin,I used this app thinking it would be female friendly but no it is full of the thirsty pigs who have no luck on Tinder. This app is a joke.
Shann Congdon,Great! Like Tinder with fewer robots.
Will Pierce,Dozens of fake profiles for every actual human; an order of magnitude less matches than Tinder or Coffee Meets Bagel; doesn't register your swipes and will keep bringing up the same profiles over and over. The only dating app that actively interferes with your using it to date!
Snoberry,"Bumble is a humbling reminder of how shallow the online dating world has become. With god knows how many matches, it's hard enough on Tinder or similar dating apps to catch a girl's eye with a witty intro or suave pickup line but when you make it so the women have to message first only the most attractive ever get messaged, leaving us average looking blokes to get sidelined and ignored. Decent concept, terrible implementation. If your goal was to avoid dick-pics and grotesque first messages, allow the guy only one message to start a convo or something and then have the match expire within 24hrs"
Ian Sprague,"Between tinder and bumble, bumble has given me like 90% of my online dates. Barely any bots. Better about layout too."
Crystal Camp,I think it's better than tinder.
Trevie3,If you're a dude you better be handsome. Conversations are better on Bumble than Tinder though.
Fancy Boyd,Better than Tinder! 😊😍
Walt Fox,"There's a lot of fake people on here. Not ""catfish"" like Tinder, but according to Bumble, there's a hotbed of 10's out in Jean, NV... Google that city though. The population is ZERO."
Erik Angerstig,Better than Tinder
Andrew Guthrie,This app is better than Tinder for pulling broads. I think it's because women go 1st it makes them feel mote empowered. IDK but I've have great success on this site. The women are definitely more open to hook ups. I highly recommend!
Daniel McAulay,"The app itself is ok but literally no one seems to want to talk on it, completely pointless and just like tinder so why use both."
Chris Hartung,"As a guy it's nice not having the pressure to initiate conversation, no bots or spam like tinder has"
Lucas LeBlanc,Better than tinder
Morgan Ballard-Wheeler,All that needs to be said is that it's better than Tinder.
Alex Rivera,Very smooth and mechanically works a heck of a lot better than tinder!
Leah Hanson,I love this way better than tinder... ive actually had way more meetings with this app
John Stephanakis,Have had more conversations in the 1-2 weeks on here than in months with Tinder.
97jettatrek,The setup it great! The women are way nicer than on Tinder. But THERE ARE NO AUDIBLE NOTIFICATIONS! Please fix!  HTC M9
Tyler Ball,Awesome so much bettet then tinder
FOREVER,Tinder recognizes my FB but not bumble. From what I experienced I can only give 1 star. no customer support.
OD GUZO,Better girls than tinder
Michael O'Dwyer,"Fantastic app, very good UI and easier to use than tinder."
A Google user,"Has fewer bugs than Tinder, but so does my garden shed. Unable to filter by active users so like Tinder you'll be wading through countless inactive accounts."
Jon Gab,Really bad algorithm.  Like really bad.  Cool concept but this ultimately is a failure.  The 24 hour conversation time limit glitches and doesn't keep people the full amount of time.  This is just a way to get payment from impatient people.  It's a watered down version of tinder but it doesn't operate as well.  Fix your app.
Faith,"Keep getting the same dudes, but the concept is pretty cool. I met my first real boyfriend on here. He was pretty cool too. But I'd rather go on tinder for more variety."
Carlos Gill,This app is ridiculous I get hundreds of matches on Tinder and none on here. It seems to only want money or the users whites.
Kevin Clayton,Works better than tinder...
D S,Better than tinder
TheDrKurtz,"Seems to be good, similar to tinder but flips the script"
Whoislikegod,Notifications are spotty but it's a great alternative to the hook up friendly Tinder. Also the girls messaging first is an amazing feature
Herbie,Way better than tinder since you don't have limited amount of likes. Thanks Bumble!
Gerard Tria,Totally easy to use and not the online bar that is Tinder. You can meet normal girls
Kishan Patel,"Haven't encountered any fake profiles, compared to similar apps such as Tinder. The app is running very well. Women respond to men first which is actually a great idea. You can also find friends, which is nice for people who move to a new city. Overall, very satisfied."
anthony villasenor,Simple app. Better then tinder. I feel like it is the more mature app than tinder.
Maurizio Sperandio,"Good app.  Neat, simple to use, and unlike Tinder you get unlimited swipes.  It could be improved on the notification side, unless you log on regularly nothing tells you that you have a message or a match so they simply disappear once the time expires.  Matches aren't frequent but generally genuine.  I'd definitely recommend, it's free."
ANDRE TRIPLETT,The women are a lot prettier than on Tinder. I like how if you mistakenly swiped left on someone you can go back.
Matteo Cesarotto,Better than Tinder!
Timothy Reagan,More real people than tinder.  Also has the option to scroll through ohotos without entering profile.
Delaney Jackson,"The selection of attractive people is better on here compared to on tinder but no one responds to my messages. Also I can't connect my spotify to my profile, every time I try my screen just goes white and nothing happens."
Ryan Sekulic,Good concept but not really sure how well run it is. There always seem to be plenty of profiles to look through but 1. Bumble seems to ignore your distance settings since they're outside it just as often as not 2. Either they're inactive profiles or fakes. I say this because in 6 months of swiping I've gotten exactly one match. I mean I could just be unappealing but the same pictures and bio do pretty well on tinder so I feel like it's a being shown to people problem.
subzerox2324,"Easy to use, the app doesn't get in the way of doing its own job like Tinder"
Aeroll Celeridad,"PLEASE READ! Great app. Great interface. Great concept. This is a legitimately well done app. Settings are simple, no photo uploading bugs, no app crashing. These one star ratings are because people are finding it to be too slow and finding it boring or no ones showing any interest in them (maybe be more interesting or take better pictures?). I personally haven't had any issues talking to people. If random hooking up is your thing, go to tinder. This app is meant to be an alternative to that style of dating app. And it did a great job standing on its own."
Becky S,"Men complain women don't message them after connecting, though most men don't bother talking at all or are looking for a hookup. More like Tinder here."
TJ Walenski,"Shows 10 super attractive people right at first that you will never match with, then shows 500 people you will swipe left on. Bad matching, way better luck on Tinder"
Erik Stroman,Better than Tinder?
Ryan,The hot girls aren't real...go on Tinder.
FlyWhiteGuy,"If you are looking to meet women,  this is the place to do it.  In my opinion much better than tinder,  on ratio of girls I've met up with.  Tinder girls like to tease.  😣"
Cam W,"I'd like to think I'm an above average looking guy. Have a good career, good head on my shoulders and an all around gentleman. I literally only matched with fat chicks or ugly chicks. I do 10 times better on tinder. And it's not because I'm looking for a hookup. I don't get it. I can swipe right allllll day on this app and I won't match WITH ANY ONE then I pull it up an hour later and I have 1 person who liked me, swipe through the models till I find who it was. Then boom. Fat chick. Boom. Ugly chick. I DON'T GET IT. And the 1 out 300 chicks that's actually attractive that I match with, doesn't effing message me!!! ):&lt;&lt;&lt;"
Brett Ogin,"The app is fine, but it's essentially tinder. Guess that's why all the same people I saw on tinder were on bumble."
Peter Murphy,Waaaaaaay better than Tinder! An app that is design properly :)
Brendan Kodric,"The UI is wonderful. Everything is smooth and works excellently.  The ability to sort your matches by distance, name, recents, ect is something that was desperately missing from tinder. The lack of notifications is an issue. I can't figure out why I won't get a notification sound, and I think it's a problem from Bumble's end.  Keep up the good work!"
Robert Parkins,"Just like tinder, crashes, won't log in, won't show anything but message""whoops the app is broken"" Can not even access settings to send this as feedback and if like tinder, why bother"
Brian Bucher,"Doesn't show your profile to others after the first few days if you're not paying for it. Tinder, OKC, POF, and CMB are all so much better."
Gevork Gevorkyan,"Seems like an edgy progressive edition of old tinder. Did they hire sorority girls to kick-start their app? Waiting for a girl to strike up a conversation is like waiting for $100 to fall into my lap. It's not impossible, but it doesn't happen often enough to make this app worth my time. I have to start catering my photos and bio to what catches most women's attention, rather than being genuine and being my best self."
Graeme Coates,"It's a better UI than tinder, but the notifications don't work that well, often I'll get messages and not get a notification."
John McC,Refreshing change to tinder!!
yames ble,It took what is wrong with tinder and made it better. Some problems but hopefully they will be fixed
Val Rie,athe distance aetting does not work. The concept behind the app is flawed. It does have a better user interface than Tinder though.
Paul Owen,"Good app , better than tinder . Problem with prostitutes needs to be sorted out . Swiped on a couple of ladies , only for them to come back with , that will be £500 to spend the night with me , I'm not that desperate !!"
Ryan Miller,Way more hot chicks than tinder
Kristi Malanga,"I'm only using the app for the bumblebff add on, and it's really cool the way it works. Styled like tinder, but more human, if you get what I mean lol"
Jabberwocky1066,I prefer this to Tinder a little frustrating playing a waiting game a better way of matching with someone I think.
Charles Moritz,Much better than Tinder.
Noel Gonzalez,"You guys are doing alright, keep up the good work and don't get greedy like tinder did."
Colin Drayton,"It far better UX than Tinder and a better design esthetic, Tinder's black and red color scheme always makes me feel slightly shady. The only thing I don't like is that if women have to talk first why, when I get a match is there a choice to message. Finally I'm not sure that every woman is ready to take on the responsibility of making the first move, I feel like by the time people are ready to throw out old gender norms the gender distinctions Bumble makes will be meaningless"
Aaron Rattley,I understand why bumble is different than tinder but the transition is difficult to adjust to. Five stars
John Mansfield,"Too many inactive profiles. Tinder deactivates profiles after a certain amount of time so you're always swiping on active people. On bumble, I could be swiping for hours on people who deleted the app two years ago. Fix this maybe I'll use this app more."
A Google user,I prefer bumble to tinder because I can send people pictures of my dog and if we are being honest that's all that really matters
Ebenezer Ndlhovhu,Better than Tinder
Shanti Pothapragada,"Interface like Tinder but way smoother, faster to see more pics or text without changing modes."
Amar Paul,Ranks people by attractiveness (which is a bit dishonest) but the interface is better than Tinder's
alex kincaid,Never got a single match as opposed to tinder and okcupid
None Anon,"Full of Bros; also as shallow tinder, matches aren't based on common interests and values"
Jonathan Pegram,Good app. I think it's a bit more chill that point and tinder as women make the first move
A Google user,Much better than tinder!!!
Lauren Gonzalez,Good app way better than tinder
Kirk Serpes,Better than tinder
Ronn Alford,Easy to use and works well... Seems more refined than Tinder
ian marcinkowski,"Overall a good experience. The lack of any way of standing out such as Tinder Super-likes means that there is little to no reason to be overly interested in any one profile, but maybe that just means this is a purer form of swipe dating app."
A Google user,It's not diverse enough like tinder.
Hogan Le,Better than Tinder. I like the concept of girls being able to msg guys they are interested in
A Google user,"Better than Tinder (no max likes per 12hrs) and I've had a lot more responses, quality-wise."
Zairin,Devs are great. Messaged them about fake profiles and they followed up quickly. Honestly a better platform than Tinder. Not as buggy and definitely easier to use. The limited backtracks per day are also nice.
Matt Moliterno,"Better than Tinder. If you put work into your profile and you are genuine on the app you have a good chance of meeting people you'll get along with. Unfortunately it won't magically fix you if you're an uninteresting person, so there's definitely room for improvement there..."
Carly Bond,App just updated and now it won't find people. Just keeps loading. Literally same thing happened with Tinder a couple weeks ago so I was glad Bumble worked...not anymore. Now you both suck evenly. Great!
Scott Squires,App is buggy and conversations never seem to get started.  Scrolling is better than tinder but otherwise tinder has this beat.  Total waste of time. Don't bother.
Sam Primmer,"The photo interface or whatever you call it is bad. It blows up photos way too big... It's no where near as good as Tinder, put it that way."
Karl Dettmann,"It's not worth the time and effort. Although the intentions are good, it ends up being polite Tinder, and taking away the ability for the guy to plead his case. Hinging a conversation's beginning on two people is hard enough, but having only the girl initiate conversation causes the likelihood of the conversation to begin to dwindle and fade. There were often the same girls two swipes after I had swiped them, as if to ask if I were sure I chose correctly. Do not download."
A Google user,It's great. Way more success than Tinder
Miss Rose,"It's not a great app for an attractive alt girl looking for a relationship in my area; lots of cops & bros. But the app itself is pretty good. I just wish we got longer bios; Tinder gives you 500 characters, Bumble only gives you 300."
Craig Cramer,"I really loved the intention of this app to empower women by forcing them to be the initiator, but the culture of women may not be ready. Profiles are too short to give any depth of description. Women do not initiate contact unless a man extends the timer first (which defeats the purpose of the app). Culture of workaholics that aren't capable of having a real relationship. And worst, 90% of women aren't comfortable with saying anything more than hi  Even after I've replied with a conversation started, most women will not continue a conversation after saying hi. Huge disappointment and I'd recommend Tinder, OkCupid, of POF if some is looking for women who are serious about dating."
Keaton Kristick,"Met my last girlfriend on Tinder. So, I figured Bumble ought to be worth a Go!"
Stuart Mathers,I like the idea women have to speak first compared to tinder.. where they're usually quite stubborn and boring. I like a girl takes initiative
Mike McManus,Easy to use. Like it better than Tinder
Brandon Palmer,The app functions well. However it allows women to collect matches and never act upon them. Really no better than Tinder in that regard.
Mark J Marra,I do not have Facebook and therefore I cannot use Bumble or Tinder they both suck
Shayna O'Connell,"I really liked this app at first, but now guys are just using this instead of tinder. A large percentage of my matches are just looking to hookup and I'm pretty sure that's what this app was trying to avoid."
Richard Quadri,Better than tinder
Old Head Uno,A lot better than tinder
Charles S. Frank,Works better than tinder!
Cory Rockwell,"Deserves to be rated much higher. I've talked to more women in the last two days since getting bumble (and have a promising date set up for tomorrow) then the last... Well ever, with Tinder. Tried Badoo too but uninstalled it after an hour because the first person I saw was my recent ex's sister and I quickly found out there are privacy issues as you can't truly block anyone. Bumble is simple and effective and the fact that women msg first means pretty much every conversation goes somewhere. Highly recommended for any non-douchebag guy :)"
James Curtis,"My feelings have changed since my first review. However, I only bothered to update this review because the trick they use when they bug me about app feedback (send me to email if I rate poorly vs. to the Play store if favorable).  I was a fan of the app initially, but it hasn’t gotten any better.  I don’t know if the big issues are poor design choices or small active user base. Probably both.  Likes: does -enough- different from Tinder et al. to provide a unique experience; doesn’t try to reinvent a simple concept. UI is -good enough-, I prefer it to Tinder when it works how I think they want it to.  Dislikes: match rate slows to a glacial crawl after the first couple weeks (in well-populated city), showing profiles that are looong inactive + many other match queue issues, picture issues (aspect ratio too restrictive/annoying, load slow) + many other misc., compounding factors.  Finally, Bumble Boost is useless. If the common problem for many men using the app is # of matches, then the features provide no benefit. I was interested in trying out the features, but they provided minimal benefit so I passed.  Disappointing app, but I'll use it from time to time to see if it's improved."
The British Grocer,"What the title said, app is OK, exactly the same as tinder, but guys have to pay.."
A Google user,"App is pretty good overall, better than Tinder in my opinion."
Don Berry,Chicks look better than tinder... But no connection yet
Trenton B,"And the results are in! Having had experience with swipe dating apps previously, I ventured into a new account with both Tinder and Bumble on the same day in the middle of Sept 2016. To keep things as accurate as possible, I placed my same pictures up in the same order with the same brief description. My findings? 1 Bumble match to every 11 Tinder matches! 1 to 11!!! It wasn't even a contest. The quality of matches was seemingly similar and it was not uncommon to match the same girl on both accounts."
GregR R,"Cool app, better than Tinder"
Graham Jantz,Seems like tinder has a way higher matching rate.. maybe I'm just ugly but still.  it also appears to have a ton of fake female profiles so maybe make a way to have less robots
Matthew Cinelioglu,"Love the idea and basically a much better version of tinder however my matches aren't showing on the app matches screen even though I still get push notifications about them and can find them by following the notification link but no other way, please help"
Tommy Turner,"It's an interesting concept. The app is nicely designed and executed, and it would be a nice alternative to tinder, but unfortunately the match rate in comparison to tinder is ridiculously low. That either says something about the amount of users or the types of girls who use Bumble, but either way if you are looking for an alternative to tinder this probably isn't it."
Ethan Chan,"I like the concept of the app. my suggestion is purely from a male user experience - I understand and like the fact the girls have to initiate the talking, but in this case, asking a guy to swipe left or right completely a taste of time. How about only let guy to submit a profile, browse and bookmark the female profiles. Only girl can like and initiate the conversation? Just push push the spectrum of the design to the right.. we are OK with that and you can more distinguished yourself from Tinder"
Alex Stanley,Not yet. But it's a better app than tinder
Connor Bell,"Bumble is a pretty and sleek looking app but it carries over the same problem that kills the usability on tinder. Women don't message first, and in an app that hinges on that very concept, nothing is really accomplished. And after the first ""hey"" the conversation almost inevitably fizzles out because the female users, at least the ones I've encountered haven't decided if this is a dating app, a friendship app, or a sex app. There is massive potential in this application to spare women some harsh comments from men, and I hope that it is well used. I had it for a year as a test, matched with close to 100 people and had 5 conversations. I'll stick to tinder or a dog park for now."
Kyle Selleck,Why can't you copy a link someone sends you?? Also why can't we link Instagram like on tinder?
A Google user,There is no way for gay people to use this. Even tinder has an option for women to meet women. A bit disconcerning in this day and age. Anyway good luck with this app.
A Google user,"Just like Tinder, this app REQUIRES Facebook. I loathe and detest Facebook and refuse to use it. Please let us use an alternative sign in method."
Sammy Livingston,"It will say you have a match, then first show you fake profiles with model pictures. And then it will try and slip in your match discreetly but it's so obvious because all of the other pictures it's been showing you. I actually play a game and guess who is my match by switching back and forth until my match goes away.  So in short, better in functionality than say Tinder but it's so full of fake profiles"
Glen Schiffman,"What I hate most is that in this age of time, girls do not approach guys to start a conversation. It's extremely rare. I hate that when I match with someone I need to wait for a woman to message me first. Who the heck is paying attention? Please make this the other way around because this looks like it can be better than tinder"
Austin Kosobuski,Better than tinder
Samuel Gershman,Glad the Tinder crowd hasn't found this yet.
A Google user,"Great idea, but the majority of profiles are inactive, they are either aware this and ignore the fact or need to update their algorithm to account for last log in time like tinder does.  Will update review on fix."
Jennie M.,It's truly a beautiful interface. I love the concept and it feels like the quality of people are better than what you'd find on tinder! :)
Jacob Pos,"You know, I've had about as many real girls on here as tinder"
Omicron Persei 8,"The idea of girls approaching you first is cool and all but it's really annying how many you match with and nothing happens. Girls constantly reappear and when you change the distance to 15km for example, it still shows profiles from at least 60km away. Can't get tinder cause the code verification won't send but unfortunately this is not the alternative option that's worth it."
Gary McSorley,Much better than tinder
Dan Neveu,Pretty annoying that the app limits you to a couple profiles then says you're out of people. I live in a city of over 1 million people and literally 2 people in and the app is out of people? I'm only limited on tinder by the number of likes in a day what is this garbage
Jonathan Way,It's great that it doesn't have the scam Bots like Tinder but I've been on the site for a month and haven't met any new people
Benny Georgescu,So far so good. Couple matches and a couple bust. A lot better than Tinder
Maclean Newman,Needs more users and also I find that after the first week I have found about 0 quality matches. This is an app where the girl takes the first step and it's great that there is a working app that tops Tinder.
Steep Snow,"Women are not initiators.  Secondly even with location on there are so many out of state profiles.  It seems bumble is trying to look relevant, showing lots profiles. but no one is on there. For ever five swipes on tinder I make 2 connections with dates.  For every 100 on bumble zero.  Plus most women in my age group have lives, kids and careers.  Their priority is not to be beholden to check the app and responding within 24 hours.  They don't have the time.  Lame, ineffective and a waste of time. Do bother"
Simon W,"This app is worse than useless. I think I'm done with online dating permanently after this. After all, I wouldn't want some nice young lady to have to endure the terrible injustice of being spoken to by me. I'll just go hit on girls at bars, since that's the best way for a male unperson to get dates in the era of bumble and tinder background checks."
Matt Mahan,"Bumble solves Tinder's problem of matches where no one talks. Sometimes the app feels under developed, but its as good as anything else on the market."
Shannon Mallory,A little more serious than tinder.
Gary Dagg,Don't want Facebook so had to reactivate account just to do what is basically tinder
Walker Child,Much better concept than tinder
Cody S,It's stable unlike tinder. Why is there no profile inactive option? IOS users have it. Kinda necessary.
Diana Dallin,The quality of guys is so much better on here then Tinder. I've been on here 3 days and I've gotten six dates!
Indrajeet Ghosalkar,Lots of fake profile. I get matched up but women aren't sending messages which doesn't make sense according to bumble's rules. I am using this for few months still didn't got any single message whereas I get lots of replies or matches in other apps like Tinder. Also it's hard to believe so many beautiful girls are living in my area. In other dating apps I can see normal people but in bumble everyone is a model. The app is a waste of time.
Josi Elizabeth,"People seem like a classier group than Tinder, but I HATE that people disappear within 24 hrs. Also, it's waaay too easy to accidentally delete someone when you're in the message section."
Rayne Valentine,"I use the app to try and find friends with other women in my area,  as my work schedule makes it difficult. And no one talks. It's boring and pointless.  Why use it if you don't plan on speaking?  Or can't hold a simple conversation?Same thing with tinder.  The app has a great idea,  but the people make it suck."
Brennon Touryan,"Like tinder, only better with less glitches.  Bravo!"
Nathan Weber,"Did y'all decide to hire the tinder support team? Cus suddenly your app won't load, won't run, won't function. I reinstalled even and now instead of freezing on the honey comb search screen it freezes on the first Bumbe logo screen. What gives?"
T SwiftFanatic1,"The app boasts that it protects girls from evil nasty men. Don't really understand how equality is trashing and treating sexes differently but whatevs. Unfortunately Bumble isn't done reminding you how unwelcome you apparently are if you are male with a combination of annoying changes, structural issues, and the passive aggressive marketing/direction. For example it used to be that while girls made the first move men had some time to think. Its gone now. Ensuring that men had absolutely no balancing advantage so that their status as 2nd class Bumble citizens was clear seems as plausible an explanation as any. Second and this is the fatal flaw many girls sign up and forget the whole purpose expecting men to initiate/continue pursuit. Men get less matches while women users can still expect frustration over no followup , and those rotten men can still send nasty messages after a like. So, its still Tinder with all problems intact but with a couple weird 'antisexist sexist' gimmicks tacked on. But hey, the app will still gladly take your money even if you are male. C'mon, Bumble's disdain for you doesn't go THAT far. Although come to think of it men/suckers are far more likely to pay."
C. ellison,"There are a lot of women on the app, unfortunately with age and other characteristics only a handful of people respond.  This app is like tinder but more classy.  Just wish the chatting interface was more friendly and easier to use."
Steve Jones,Worse than tinder. Yet another app women can use to completely dismiss me.
Jason Fuller,"Seems like higher quality people than tinder, but the app can take quite a while to load up and recent stopped obeying the distance requirements I had set."
Mike Bartolo,Very impressed. More matches then tinder.
Jeremy Warren,Love it. Better than tinder
Christian Méza,These apps have a hard time trying to meet the goal of their appeal. A principle of a service or product is quality. How do you ensure the quality of an interaction is meeting standards. Just a hair above Tinder. Four stars
B Anderson,The app automatically signed me up for a monthly subscription that I knew nothing about. I didnt realise the money was getting taken out till i looked at my bank statement and wondered whats this charge... shame on the app!!! On another note i found most males were using this as a tinder. Just looking for sex.
Patrick Woo,"if women are suppose to take the first move why is there a 24hrs wait time for them to text. They should've send a greeting right after they swipe right.   You programmed the app to insist that I should send a message first, which defeats your idea of women taking the first step. Your app is just another tinder with a different icon."
Mirsad Redzovic,"Avast detects this as MALWARE. Also; The amount of FAKE PROFILES on this thing is paramount. This app is designed to raise your physical standard of women so that you end up single your entire life. It's a psychological weapon. It's as if the creator got butthurt from tinder and decided to create her own app to screw every guy over. Oh wait, that's actually nearly all true! Look it up! At least the idea of the app is good."
Kyle Wheeler,I find bumble deals with some aesthetic and connection issues that tinder fails with. Classier feel.
William McCluskey,"This app is basically a tinder clone, but with a few twists. I think the twists are smart and work, but why I'm writing this review is because of the app itself. Tinder on Android is terrible. It crashes almost every time I open it. Message notifications never work, and it's location reporting is often way wrong.  I've only used bumble for a few days, but it's clearly a stable build."
LC,Exponentially better than tinder
A Google user,"Used it daily, I at first assumed I had high standards... even ended up swiping right for *every* woman, regardless of their profiles being empty or opposing to what I wanted, just as an experiment... and now I have no idea of who finds this app useful. Sticking to Tinder and OKC."
A Google user,How do I have 70+ matches on Tinder and a whopping total of maybe 6 matches on bumble? Fix the way your algorithm takes my personal profile info account and I'll fix the rating I've given you. Pretty sure I'm not even being shown to the majority of users at this point.
Existential D,No way to log in unless you use Facebook. Not interested ib joining Facebook just for this tinder clone
Rebecca Rosefelt,"Love using it, less creepy user base than tinder. Often says there's nobody nearby, but also that I have 56+ (whatever number) unseen matches. Some bugs using the chat feature on my old HTC but fine on my Samsung."
David Worker,No bots unlike Tinder where there's so make fake profiles
Jasmine S,Better than Tinder
Steven Lamb,"Like tinder except you don't get any matches, so you can't even ruin it my being hopelessly dull."
A Google user,"All straight women need to download this app, much better guys who aren't crazy like the ones on Tinder.  More relationship and honest guys"
Jean-François Anstead,This solves the problem they get of overloaded inboxes full of creeps plus they get to realize how hard it really is to open up with icebreakers 100s of times a week just to be ignored time after time again. WELCOME TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION LADIES. Best dating app out there by far and it was made by the cofounder of Tinder and Badoo so you know it's well made. Not even inundated with ads or the like. Fantastic app! P.S. soo many women in the reviews giving bad reviews because they're being ignored!
A Google user,Much better than tinder
Brian Hayes,Better then tinder
Josiah Ward,"I was using bumble for a little bit and it kept telling me I had a 5-17 people in my match que so I decided to update and buy the premium version. Soon as I did that my match que was and has been completely empty .. it's been 2 weeks.. not a single match que , yet I can go to tinder and get 1-3 matches a day so I know it's not me."
Robert Schaeffer,Like a less trashy version of tinder.
S Hanes,"I gave it a week and I get maybe 15 matches on tinder, Absolutely ZERO activity on here. Matches not in age range or selected preferences, what's the deal?? plz fix and I'll be happy to try again."
Artful Dodger,"Good UI, functions reasonably well with only minor bugs/inconveniences, and the defining ideas of limited response time and ""women go first"" are pretty good. Anywhere outside a large city, however, this is a waste of time. I live in a town of 6000 with another 10 000 in the surrounding area and have gotten two matches in a month, consistently running out of people to swipe. Neither match messaged within the 24 hours (I am a male seeking females). Tinder simply has too many users (I've had 30+ matches there and much more messaging) and this app doesn't do enough better to persuade me to keep using it, let alone spend money on it.  If you like those two divergent features (limited response window + women message first) and live in or near a population centre of at least 50k, try it out. Otherwise, Tinder is a better choice."
A Google user,"I was hesitant at first, because I didn't want to be the one to reach out. However, after using tender, I realize this app is way better. It allows for larger size photos, it's easier to scroll through and view all pictures and profiles, communication is easy and I like the filters for mileage, age etc. Definitely would recommend. I hated the Tinder app! This is a breath of fresh air."
A Google user,Had one match in two weeks while using this app. In tinder I have several new matches a day. Maybe the algorithm is just bad?
Miguel Cervantes III,Better than tinder
Huw Baldwin,Better than tinder
David Spalding,"I'm enjoying this app. It's simple, not too many bells & whistles, and does what it needs to. Minimal notifications: new connection, new message, that's it. The service has a neat twist, women have to send the first message after a match, and they have 24 hrs in which to do it. You can grant an extension once per day. After only a few days use, I've made some interesting connections, and met someone offline with more to come. One weakness, like other apps, it identifies the person with where they are when using the app, so visitors to your city show up as ""local."" My only complaint is the very limited space for your profile text. You have to be very brief. Closest corollary is Tinder, and I like this better."
Reymund Bautista,Seems like there are more professionals here compared to Tinder.
Jordan Beer,Way better than Tinder
Jonathan Lourenco,It is similar to Tinder but those small changes make it surprisingly better.
A Google user,"This app isn't as popular as say Tinder or OkCupid, so if you have a small dating pool to begin with because of your location all this app will do is further shrink it. I have had issues with most of my few matches not showing up in the match page so I couldn't message them, but maybe I was just unmatched. This app doesn't really tell you either way. I also feel like the majority of the accounts are inactive in my area because of the lack of people. It would be better if they showed the last date online."
Ching Liang,"I get matches and dates from Tinder, but I've only gotten one match on Bumble since I downloaded it a few months ago. Are users on Bumble even active?"
Joel Schnall,"Primary concept is flawed, but I like the vertical swipe through gallery.  Notifications are broken, continuing to send even after unmatching someone.  Like Tinder, which it clones, essentially useless for actually finding a decent date."
Neil Chand,Had some matches but wanted me to pay to see who. Lame! Giving tinder a try
Nicholas Sappington,New twist on tinder
andrew johnson,"Forced to choose from a list of occupations that don't apply to my bad ass job, got maybe 20 swipes before I ran out, resembles a sad knock off of tinder, will be uninstalling 5 mins after downloading. Also I never review anything, that's how much I dislike this sloppy suck-fest."
A M,Love the BFF side just in case you want a break from dating and just want a girls/guys night instead 😊 Its nice to switch back and forth and girls get to initiate conversation which is cool too! Not as many creeps as tinder which is the best part!
Physixtential,"This app has all the functionality you wish tinder had, and it runs way way better with a smooth chat system."
A Google user,"Seems ok so far, perhaps just needs more people to use it. Love the functionality, vastly prefer it to tinder and how it's a success 😊"
Dan Wilson,Like tinder almost
Mary Skywalker,So helpful and much classier than tinder!
J Chin,This dating app is worst than Tinder at least Tinder is free! What's the use of this app if you can't even talk to your matches.. Bye Bumble!
Walter Fritz,Great app. No spam bots or fake profile crap. I deleted my Tinder account after 2 days using Bumble.
Huw Swanborough,Better than tinder for actual talking and meeting people... But give me a rewind button for accidental dislikes!!
A Google user,"First day is full of successful 8-10s. Everything drops to a 5 after that. Got harassed, emailed support, and no response. Rather be on tinder."
Android Testerer,"Like Tinder, allows you to like the profiles of others, and should both parties secretly like each other, then the 'match' is revealed and both parties can then message each other freely. Unfortunately, this app has severe limitations that Tinder does not have: Requires Android 4.1 and + (less users means less potential matches). Profiles are limited to 300 characters (500 on Tinder). Only a female can write a male after matching, and both a message from a female AND a reply from the male must occur within a 24 hour period, else the match expires (if a match expires and you want to get it back, then you have to pay). From my experience, this app that 'empowers' women practically encourages the 'match and unmatch' practice that plagued Tinder months ago, meaning that women seem to be not all that serious about dating using this thing, but rather just like the attention from knowing they are receiving 'likes' that they can then let expire with a 'whoops' and a wink."
Jeff Ritter,"Bumble is the best swipe dating app out there. It's a lot like Tinder, if Tinder graduated from college and had a successful job."
Taylor Lovell,Swiped through at least 200 people and not a single match out of them where on tinder I'll usually get 4-5 at least
Darice H,More effective than tinder
Paul Garcia,Still better than tinder
joseph jean,Great app i think its better than tinder.
Raphael,Its a copy of Tinder without the match... I got 1 match and I couldn't even talk to her.
Robin Senseney,Lots of hot guys lol. The 24 hour window seems a bit tight. Stresses me out a bit. Doesn't seem to slow down my phone like Tinder does.
Kat Thompson,Better quality people than Tinder. It's really selective and I don't get a lot of matches.
Henry Mccormack,"After a couple days of no matches, I decided to just swipe right until I run out of girls, still nothing. I switch to tinder and get 3 matches within minutes. Bumble as a good concept, but it clearly just doesn't work."
Martin Campbell,Not really a lot of people on it. They really need to ramp up their presence in the UK if they want to compete with Tinder
Anthony Sauceda,Way prettier than tinder
Quinn Howard,Better than tinder.
Jen Hanley,I tried app for over a month to give it a good chance.  It's just got too little people in my area.  Guys complain there no girls and I find what little guys there are don't reply. The time limit is a pain as I'm a busy girl and forcing how long I have to reply and chat ect. The idea is good as guys that do talk are lovely because they depend on girls messaging them. It's made too much like tinder but it's layout does not work for that it wants to do. I really wanted this app to work and was disappointed.
Florencio Montanez,Nothing to match. Ill stick with tinder
Caleb Reeve,"The interface is great, better than Tinder. The best looking females, the ones I would think get the most right swipes, seem to be front loaded. And oddly, none of them ever want to match with me. Which must mean I'm not as handsome as my mom said I was. That makes me sad."
Aida Medina,"I don't like that doesn't require a good description of the person, is loosing time and turning into Tinder just an other hook up app, could have more potential to turn into a serious app."
Andrew Drennan,There are sooooo many fake looking accounts or people who are clearly not in my area. The girls I have met have been weirder than tinder...
Assassin Giant,"The only thing I don't like about this app is you can't contact the woman. The app does not have limited ""like"", so that is better than Tinder, but unlike Tinder, you can't contact first. One nice thing, is that you know they are interested completely bc they messaged you. One thing I found a little irritating is that some women aren't on the app often so when they do notice that we matched the time is either at the wire, or they don't notice at all and the match expires. For this reason u could message"
Randy Alarcon,This one seems a bit more dull than Tinder. At least with Tinder they have a brief description with info or IG tags.  This app has nothing. Shame cuz theres some nice looking babe's. But no way to contact them.
Paul Goldenbear-Garcia,"So far so good, this app seems to be more effective than tinder"
Dillon Meicke,"Less spam, more functional and ladies first make it better than tinder for me."
Andrew Niederdorf,Better than Tinder but that's not saying much. Less known app so less matches. Appears to be more well rounded and attractive people on here.
Daniel Clark,"Tinder gets plenty of matches, bumble gets 0. All bots and filler profiles. You're put on bottom of popularity unless you pay to ""boost yourself up"". Lame"
Philip Elder,"Love it , I like it better than Tinder"
Benjamin Arcioni,"Well designed UI, easy to use. No problems with crashing or freezing so far. Some loading issues however they are likely network related rather than the app. Overall a good improvement on the tinder model, especially allowing scroll through of pictures without extra clicks."
Ragena Eakman,I went on this app after being fed up with the losers on Tinder and I couldn't be happier with my choice!
Kolawole Alli,If the app gets more people and more activity it would definitely over take Tinder without much effort. Find a way to bring it into the mainstream and progress will make this even better.
Sisko Defiant,"I have had no trouble having conversations or mutual likes on other apps, but this one isn't worth the effort if you are a decent straight guy.  You may as well play Meghan Trainor's ""No"" in the background if you are a guy using this.  All this app does is empower women to be superficial.  At least with Tinder it is an even playing field."
Garrett Leeper,"I was pretty skeptical about this app at first, but someone convinced me to try it out.  The first thing I noticed is that the quality of women was noticeably higher than Tinder or POF.  The concept where women have to initiate the conversation is very interesting.  I've seen firsthand how ridiculous and overwhelming a females inbox can be just from tinder, so this kind of helps keep that under control.  I also liked how there is a ""BFF"" category for those who truly ""aren't looking for hookups"" lol."
Jose Hernandez,1 year of the app and I've had 1 match. They never messaged me. I know I'm not a looker but really? I actually had matches on Tinder. Bumble blows.
Lauren Hayden,"This app works like tinder, but is has some better features. Only issue is that there aren't enough people using it and (like any dating site) most people look nothing like their pics. Make sure you face time with them before meeting up."
Lucas Bodnyk,"I like swiping up to change pictures. This whole ""ladies go first"" thing though, it doesn't really do much when the first message is, ""hi"". Also the userbase is rather small. I prefer it over Tinder, but that's not saying much."
Mario Hicks,Quality matches. Better matches than tinder.
Zac Schaefer,"No success yet, and doesnt refresh too often as tinder can quite frequently"
Kevin Sangiovanni,"You have allowed this site to be taken over by Transgender Men - 90% of all profiles are now TG - Look closely!  This misrepresentation is obnoxious and egregrious, they have ruined this site and taken advantage of a medium in which heterosexual misrepresentation is rampant already -  Its not longer possible to trust ANYTHING on Bumble!  How could you let this happen?  It's happened on Tinder and POF too...TG, what do you think is going to happen??? Shame on you!"
Sheena M,They guys are much cuter than Tinder.
Troy Winkelman,"This is a wonderful app, and I prefer it to Tinder, but you have to give a woman incentive to swipe/respond as well. I've had tons of matches on this app. Only 3 women have responded."
Warren Marsh,"Bumble recently fixed some bugs which is great. Although there seems to be quite a few minimally active users. So far about 30% of matches have contacted me, which seems quite high for a liberal athiest in the south ;). Bumble does significantly front-load it's most attractive users mixed with your admiring swipes. I do prefer the interface over Tinder"
Joshua Gutierrez,"A little buggy, but I've gotten way more matches and interactions than tinder. As soon as they crush the few bugs it will be great"
Simon J.,"The app is itself is pretty awesome but like tinder, it has this bug where it doesn't tell you if you matched. I get 1-2 matches a day on tinder but in 2 weeks I haven't gotten a single match on here. Not working as intended"
Jasmine Teague,This is a great app! Definitely better than tinder. For sure dating
Isaiah Snell-Feikema,"Better platform than Tinder. More responsive, seems more resilient to failure. Doesn't drain battery life as quickly as Tinder either. As a user, it is pretty much what you'd expect for the design. Girls typical just say ""hey!"" but the expiration timer seems to help encourage conversation, which is good."
A Google user,"Only 3 matches in over 8 months of use?? Something is seriously wrong with their algorithm or coding.  In the same time period, i've gotten 110 matches on tinder. Fix this bumble, or there's no reason to continue using this app"
Saint George,What's up with these apps not really being friendly to people of color... Or even trying to invite them in. Well at least it's not as blatant as tinder or POF. Eh
KidOmega Zero,Just over 20 days on occasional usage burnt through 1.17 GB of data. There is absolutely no reason for it to have used even close to that amount. Especially when I keep running out of people to swipe and have to wait a few days for more to appear. I'm on tinder more often and that app only used 20% of what bumble did. Anyways the only bumbling is the script kiddies that threw together this poorly coded app. See ya later.
Peter Rangel,"The app is slick and very usable. It should be worth noting that over 1.5 months I had 3 conversations and they were less than 5 back and fourths. A common response is that I need to have a more ""interesting"" profile. I assure that was the case, I just think in general women aren't using this app as heavily as they are tinder."
Ryan Rhodes,"There are too many professional pictures and pretty women for this not to be scam.  No matches like i get on tinder, i think most of these are bots"
Will,"Because of the girls message first feature, only women who are keen message. This reduces the wasted time prevalent in Tinder"
Laurence Desautels,"Forces me to talk to people first, and quickly too, and since it doesnt have the reputation tinder has (hookup site) its so much better :P"
Charles Hollis,"The people are more attractive than Tinder however/consequently, there are fewer matches"
Carleigh-Anne Anderson,"Better looking men than tinder, but not near the selection. Overall good app."
Angie Fisher,This site is better than Tinder there are more professional men
Salvador Izaguirre,Alot of fake users. Googled pics. But basically like tinder. And how ofter do women actually make the first move? Not often
Roberto Ruiz,Its a nice app its like tinder but opposite which is ok but honestly im not having any fun. Its hard to meet new people and and most of them just match cause they want attention instead trying to get to know you as a person which its disappointing. I don't think this is the app for me after all.
A Google user,"Much better than Tinder. I like the app, easy to use. Also I appreciate the fact that the women have to initiate conversation. No unsolicited messages."
Robert Potter,"Except nobody ever uses it, but nobody ever uses tinder, happen or match, zoosk, eharmony or any of the others either. There are just too many guys falling all over themselves for the girls to sort through them all so they give up."
Mark Hodges,"I prefer this app to Tinder, less dodgy profiles, easier to use.... But lots of bugs. Matches drop off my list then reappear days later. Recent conversations drop to the middle of the list for no reason. Keeps saying I have no internet connection when I do. Tells me I have no more people to see but as soon as I restart the app there are plenty again. Lots and lots of bugs for an established app."
Todd Kurchina,"The concept is great, much more ""real"" than apps like Tinder. However the software itself has some glitches to it which might require patience."
joe trakalo,"It's easy to use and by far my favorite.  It's free, except for if you want to see who liked you. The part I like the most, as a guy, is if you match the women write to you first. It makes it easy to know they are genuinely interested. The only negative is its like tinder in that it doesn't have you fill out a real profile. Other than that it's a great app."
manto08,"Doesnt do what its meant to, which is match people.... hardly get any interest havent arranged one date from this app im still using tinder"
lulu queyar,Tinder responds more than the people on this site. Not for me.
Zane Alexander,The people are real ish but it is just like Tinder
Mike Stone,"Similar to Tinder although it's obvious that the first 5 profiles that pop up on the search are always fake profiles of the most beautiful women, then you see the rest of the genuine profiles. The backtrack popup that always comes up if you tilt the phone is also annoying and impossible to get rid of."
A Google user,"I enjoy the app; it's simple and better managed than Tinder (personal opinion) only critique I'd make is I tried to download Bumble Boost, but couldn't for one reason or another..."
Paul Gordon,"Every time I try to reopen this App it crashes. If I want to use it it turns into a game against the software and the software wins. It's a terrible app, and tinder is easier to use, even if it's patrons are less eligible"
Cliff Savage,"It worked like it said, a Tinder where the girl comments first. Now most woman on dating apps are fickle enough but this is about the app. It just stopped working after a while, it wouldn't load saying, ""no internet connection"" i tried on my WiFi and Data, nothing. Just go on Tinder and have morals... Don't waste your time."
Cody Heisinger,"This Tinder wannabe falls short of a good formula.  You can pay extra money to extend the expiration limit past 24 hours, yet possibly for a message that will never come.  If somebody has a busy day and doesn't check,  your match is gone forever.  This sexist app is feminist friendly, yet all revenue is generated by the guys? Bad. Bad. Bad."
Nick Brunck,I know tinder had some pretty terribly functioning versions but this completely takes the cake.  Absolutely nothing loads.  I most certainly do have a network connection which every other app on my phone uses just fine.  Did you do any testing on this release...at all?
Traveler,"The app doesn't seem to be working and rarely offers anyone to even consider, it's always ""thinking"". Is there no one in my area using the app? Doubt it. Based on the conversations I have had with matches, I'm not even sure I've matched with a real person or with fictitious profiles created to keep me on the app. This app was supposed to provide a more legitimate and safe environment than tinder. Fail. Don't advertise as a free app then try to manipulate people to pay to make it work properly."
Ben Parker,"I used to be a fan of Bumble, its approach with girls messaging first was quite appealing and I found it a better alternative to Tinder than any other dating app. However, since the introduction of the paid ""beehive"" feature I think it's gone massively downhill. I've just spent 10 minutes swiping and my queue hasn't gone down once? I mean c'mon, talk about putting off your customer base! At least if you're going to introduce a pay wall make it still useable and worthwhile for free users... terrible!"
David LaHaie,"Though the idea is alluring, they really just want you to subscribe to the match queue which tinder gives you for free. The occasional first message is not worth it. Don't waste your time. Just another company with their hand out. But hey, it's what puts the food on the table for them. Just not for me and if it doesn't sound appealing, probably not for you."
Erik Hogue,"I was hoping this would be like Tinder without the Facebook integration. I shouldn't have to have a profile on a separate site to use an app. I get that you want to weed out fake profiles but it isn't hard to just make a spoof profile and use that. I don't want a Facebook, so I guess I can't use or recommend your app."
Billy Chan,Good app.  But does the Tinder thing where it breaks after swiping for some time.
Amanda Yollin,Probably 99% of people on here are models with fake profiles just to get you to sign up. Nobody ever answers. Literally the worst app ever! Way to try to make it seem like it's better then Tinder by saying women have the control. IT'S NOT! At least Tinder has real people!
Just Baize,It's one step quicker than tinder because you don't need to click the picture to see the other pictures.  You just scroll up.  The selection seems nice so far.
Assata A. N. Griffin,The guys on here are definitely hotter than the ones on tinder 😉 and it's nice to have matches disappear after a day so I don't have to constantly see their faces when they never reply to my first message 😅
neel naik,Most useless app I have ever seen . Tinder rocks
Jason Heiser,Just go with POF or Tinder or even Happn and don't waste your time waiting for connections that never appear.
Tyler Payne,"Tinder works well, but this app puts profiles in your swipe queue regardless of your location settings. Even if you have it set to 2 miles, you see the most popular profiles in your queue from 40+ miles away. Location does not matter. Popularity does. Uninstalled."
jamie paoletta,"This is mostly fake accounts featuring beautiful women, just like what match does, to lure men in. Women do not have this issue. Just stick with Tinder, at least those bots respond!"
Jaclyn Sovocool,"I generally feel like the guys on bumble are more interested in a relationship, and tinder is for hookups.  Then again, there's always exceptions to the rule 😂😂"
17andbluejeans 97,Better than tinder
Michael Browne,"You'll get maybe 1/2-1/3 of the matches that you get with something like Tinder, and almost no messages. Which is really a shame. I WANT to like Bumble, I want it to succeed, but until they do something to encourage women to send the first message (as they must on Bumble) beyond the 24hr time limit, it just won't. My first thought is to limit the number of right swipes women have as a ratio to the number of first messages they send, but I have no suggestion as to what the exact ratio should be."
Melissa Burtnett,"I like the concept of the app a lot better than tinder and hot or not, but most of the profiles seem fake. Lots of matches but only 1 out of 10 actually respond. Lot more responses from real people on other dating sites."
Brent Krohn,"Not enough people are on this, but they should be. Better design than Tinder, and far less of a pain for the ladies."
Anthony,Tinder is the best
A Google user,"Its like tinder, but with significantly less diversity and more mindless swiping."
Jose Padilla,Basically tinder except they try and charge for every little thing
A Google user,"It's similar to tinder, but has more career minded people on the this site, not saying tinder don't..."
Justin Lai,"I had a suspicion a while back about this Bumble thing. Most notably compared to Tinder the girls shown are all clearly much more attractive. Then I started seeing some friends on Bumble. Problem was many of them already were in relationships. When I asked some of them they all told me that they were not on Bumble nor have they ever been on Bumble or even downloaded it. It appears, Bumble is just pulling profiles from Facebook regardless of if they're even on the app, seriously diluting the match pool."
Max Nau,Very smooth.not like tinder. Met my wife on here
Samuel Torres,Could be better if you didnt purposely throttle matches like tinder
Peter Viglietta,"Just a slightly snarkier knock-off version of Tinder. The 'ladies first' thing is a decent idea but just ends up putting the burden on the girl. Also they are unfortunately following suit with the boneheaded idea of not just letting you redo your last swipe.. cause ya know people never swipe quickly on this thing or anything. Just another dumb social media trend, will be outta here in no time.. keep it movin"
Jaclyn Peek,It basically has the same interface as tinder except my pictures are randomly zoomed waaaay in and it looks stupid and I can't do anything about it.  Also no matches have messaged me back.  This one's a dud.
Jacob Bush,"Bumble is a refreshingly new: more personable version of Tinder. Like the atmosphere, and that ladies have to make the first move. Although rating it at 4 stars because my app is bugging out and not matching me with anybody-strangest thing."
D Mendoza,This is just tinder minus the harassment. I'm making judgments on appearance alone. No thanks
A Google user,Awesome app! I'm really glad they flipped the tinder game on its head and have the girls respond first. I'm looking for something real and now I don't feel like a creep
Jose Garcia,It is better than tinder.....
Brian Falbo,"This is pretty much Tinder, but it gives the women the initiative by only letting them start a conversation. A bit depressing when you get a match and no chat though ;)"
Tom Hall,Nice interface and has nicer basic features than Tinder but I'm thinking it is stuffed with fake people.  I've liked a lot and never heard from anyone.  I know I'm no 10 but come on.
Megan M,Lots of matches but very few quality conversations. Let alone basic replies to my initial greetings. Seems just like another Tinder masking itself as a relationship app.
Chris Pearcey,So much better than Tinder!
John McLean,Better than tinder the ppl are almost better looking... The while feminist side of it is a bit too much even for a person that respects it but oh well
A Google user,More fake profiles than tinder and pof combined. Women still don't talk after matching. Don't waste your time
A Google user,"Most girls like guys to make the first move. We can't on bumble, which pretty much renders it useless. It's way less buggy than tinder though. Judging it as an app though, beautiful app."
A Google user,"Like tinder, but they dont cut off any matching"
JayCorone,Don't try this app. Paid for the month and it won't  let me through to make my matches. Should be free like Tinder. That app is much better than Bumble.
Nicole Heasley,"Lots of really attractive guys, but I get very, very few matches. Way less than I get on Tinder. I think it has a higher number of fake accounts."
alexboguslawski,Better than tinder so far as I haven't been sent spam or gotten asked for my credit card yet.
Kevin Jon,It is worst then tinder. Bunch of garbage app circulating with fake rating n fake pics. Actually no actual/real girl here to respond.
Retro Lord,I swipe a thousand infinite times with only one match but with tinder I'm matching all the time.
Derek Pack,"It's odd that an app that's trying to market itself more as relationship app than its hook up app competitor, tinder, would be so bad at providing potential matches that reside and not just visiting the area. Its a Christmas day miracle when you read someones bio and they are actually living on your area. This may be simply that not many locals in my area use bumble and prefer tinder but it doesn't explain why there is no option to filter out people just visiting on a supposed relationship orientated app"
Ben,"As a long time Tinder user there were some things about Bumble that were refreshingly better immediately.  First the vertical swiping flow and portrait orientation on photos.  Also swiping through the app is smooth like butter with two hands.  Second while I haven't paid yet, the Beeline feature seems smart and efficient for finding matches.  One thing that was obvious though was when I first started swiping they had front-loaded many girls who were clearly very attractive which I'm sure wasn't an accident."
A Google user,Lots of lovely ladies on this app but they never talk when you match and we dont even get a chance to fire off anything... sometimes in an effort to be different these apps fail and Im tired of not actually meeting anyone off this app. Tinder and Happn have delivered multiple times and yet this never has.
Hung Sewell,Never get matches and I swipe right on everyone. Plus side is unlimited swipes and no ads like tinder.
keepcheatin,"Maybe I'm just in a place where not enough people know of it, but unlike tinder, I have absolutely struck out on this app. Haven't received one message even. Maybe better for bigger cities, but not rural...states."
Louie Centanni,"Maybe it's just bad luck, but I get far fewer matches here (than Tinder) and only about 10% initiate. To quote Elaine Benes, ""Is it possible that I'm not as attractive as I think I am?"" But seriously, a dating app with no dates defeats the purpose. I do much better in person or on OKCupid."
Morgan Erlich,"Just what the world needed, a tinder that also conveys the sexist undertones of society. Two steps forward,  one back, it seems."
Jon Riordan,Doing exactly what tinder did in the beginning. Getting models at promo events to set up accounts. Not real people.
JamesAaron,Have only made like 2 matches in a month and a half... Once this becomes more popular it should be better than Tinder.
Tim Sawicki,"I have no problems matching on any other dating app (even Tinder after you sift through the obvious fake profiles), but I have probably matched with 10 people total in my entire 9-10+ months of using this. Also, very obvious that they put the most attractive/swiped people first which is frankly a terrible approach (although I'm sure women love effortlessly avoiding the million cringy neckbeards). Many profiles are suspiciously model hot (likely fake). Not worth the effort. Use literally anything else."
Tiglath Aggriever,Better than Tinder
Cory Johnson,I liked Bumble better than Tinder previously. Seemed to be higher quality matches and I was getting tons of them along with lots of emails. Then I made the mistake of installing the update. Haven't gotten a single new match in quite awhile and all that's up in my match queue are ones I'd need to pay for. Nah. I'll see if a reinstall fixes it but I doubt it. Probably just go back to Tinder and uninstall Bumble for good if this doesn't fix it.
Melanie Lofthouse,It's like a pay for dating same as tinder..but even when u match they never talk..nothing changes
Jamie Owen,Not as much fun ....too complicated now you want me to pay to see people. No thanks I'll go back to.tinder
leon jones,"The changes are nice and the BFF feature is nice, but compared to sites like okcupid, POF and Tinder this one is very discouraging. Like i said before i love the idea but i get the feeling that ladies will always be looking for something better, or maybe add a filter for those that are just looking to date and those that want something serious."
Lln Lndvr,"Functionality wise the app is great, although I get a lot of girls from other parts of the country (they put they live someplace else on description), but show up as if they were 30 miles away. People still as superficial as in tinder and girls still won't say anything other than ""hi"" (the main complaint about guys contacting them)"
James Husted,"Inactive accounts are not removed from circulation.  The ""most liked"" accounts are front loaded every time you log in (distance preferences are ignored).  If you swipe right ""too many times"" your profile is actually flagged and you get put at the bottom of the pile, but the line is arbitrary and there's no way to ""unflag"" yourself. Extremely disappointed. Just stick with Tinder."
Kevin Di Stefano-Williams,"Intuitive, and I love the concept that women have to talk fist. Breaks down a lot of problems with tinder and other dating apps. Only problem is there isn't enough characters or display to show any bio info. It should still have a better way to connect people by interests or preferences."
Ian M,"A much better interface than Tinder, but the limited bio section kills it. Also a much smaller population. Add to that their new changes to try to get people to pay...and you have a lackluster experience. I'm about done with it."
Daniel Goncalves,"I would use this over tinder.. Its just less know and therefore a bit less people. The idea is really cool,  love it"
Darren Elliott,"Most people I've talked with are regular, everyday nice people. The type of people it attracts tends to be higher quality than Tinder. Most people I've met have advanced degrees and have their life together."
Temisan S,"As a guy I like how this app makes women initiate the first message, because it makes it more likely that your match is actually interested in pursuing something. The quality of women is also much better than tinder."
Chevy Bonney,"Much better women then tinder, only match with people who genuinely wanna talk to you and get to know you!"
jesse way,"It's easy to use, and thank God for no robots. All the way better than tinder"
Dane Walls,It's an okay app. I prefer this to tinder and other applications
Owen Marble,"It's a bunch of guys claiming no matches and no girls talking to them. I get a match or two a day and maybe two girls striking up a conversation a week. That's about all you need, otherwise just stick to skeezing on tinder. I say GOOD DAY SIR!! :)"
Shana Gerendasy,Better than Tinder! More attractive educated people to chose from!
Kyle Gordon,It has gone wrong where tinder went wrong. Sure I think paying to have extra abilities is fine but don't punish me for not paying.
Nathan Wilkins,"I live in a decent size city, so Bumble stays pretty active. So much better than Tinder. Tinder is full of spam accounts now, and so far I haven't encountered any with Bumble. I've had some great conversations with cool girls. I'm sure eventually it'll be saturated with the trash like Tinder is.. but for now, it's pretty great. One suggestion tho: give the app a refresh button. Sometimes it says I'm out of people when I'm not. I can change the mile radius to something lower and squeeze out a few more ppl."
Loren Corralez,Better than tinder
Ray Shieh,Seriously this site has more fake accounts than tinder
Stewart,Seeing all the attractive women on here and getting to the end of the available people and not having a single match reminds me of how ugly and depressed I am. But the layout is better than tinder so I'll give it a 2.
Jordan Haynie,"I have been on here for almost a week. It's like tinder, everyone swipes right and then when you do message one of the guys first, he doesn't respond. I believe I messaged about 15 guys and only one has responded. I'm going to give it a bit longer to see id it improves at all."
Marco D.,"Been using it for approx. 1 day and already quite a few matches. Great looking women, love the role reversal as far as first contact. Easy to use, free, and unlimited swipes. Already I like it better than Tinder."
Anthony K,"Matches are from weeks ago, always says there are no people, even expanding the search criteria and being near big cities. Recently showed ""new"" matches, BUT WERE FROM WEEKS AGO AND EXPIRED! This app is awful, can't believe I'm saying it but Tinder is better."
Karly Green,Way less bots then tinder
Chris G,"I've been on it for a week now, swiping away and nothing...nada...no response. Waste of phone space, just like Tinder!"
Deepak Venkateswaran,"I've tried the app 4-5 times over the last few months. Swiped on many profiles and not a single match, even on profiles I've seen on (and matched on Tinder). Completely useless."
Brett Veary,Cool concept but everyone has deserted it already so it's useless! Looks like Tinder wins this one
A Google user,"Good app, I like the more gentle atmosphere compared to tinder"
He's ONE FUNNY GUY,Seem to not get one single match! While on tinder I average about 5 a day.
Mike Griffin,Better than Tinder
Rebecca Griffin,Seems to be nicer people on here than Tinder which seems just to be for hook-ups
B W,"The only thing they have going for them is the quality of good looking women. When you like them and match, nothing happens. No contact from the women, and when you ""extend"" you get nothing either. Waste of time. Your chances are better with tinder."
Tom Robinson,"Great way of connecting people, far fewer girls with duck faces than on tinder."
Samuel Gilbert,"Nice UI, seemed like there were lots of high quality girls, but I got 2 matches in almost 3 weeks of use, and neither of them contacted me...after the first week started right swiping much less selectively just to see if I could get a match.  Seems like either something fishy going on, or its just a bad idea.  At least there's a chance of interaction on tinder.  Wouldn't recommend."
Robert Verrastro,"I dig the premise of the app, it's a great idea because of how us guys can be. One issue I'm seeing, besides getting one match a month, is there are quite a few ""fake"" or ""bot"" profiles coming across my page, almost exactly like tinder. I believe there could be and should be some sort of authentication to prove you're who you claim to be. But other than that, keep up the good work!"
Matt Braun,"In theory this seems like it would be good. However, the majority of women around the world would never message a man first. Women have the opportunity to message men first on every other app and roughly 1% actually do so an app focusing on narrow margins is just ridiculous. For all those complaining about Tinder, just remember, the girls had to first like all the douchebags before they could get a message from them. This app does have a pretty good interface though"
Frank Jakubiec,"Can't figure out the Konami code to get interest, but such is life. Seems like there is actual DNA behind the profiles instead of just 1's and 0's asking you to be a Turing test of sorts like OKC, Tinder."
Anthony Presto,Love this app. I used tinder for a while but got tired of the fake profiles. Have had great luck with this app. Made many friends and have had a few dates.
Aman Singh,Better than tinder in every way
Philip Cooke,"Update 8 Aug 2016:  app works as expected now. Pretty much the same as tinder, but with less people and functionality. Profiles get recycled, you'll see the same people every other week or dip.In the Denver area, I get about 3 matches per month.                                Stuck with Ted Cruz logo on my main page. Apparently, iphone sheep get to manage this, i don't. It's like the developers are putting effort in to making this app screwy"
lori Colburn,Sooo much better than tinder!the guys are less creepy and actually want to have a conversation with you!
Carolyn S,"Aside from occasionally/rarely having the app mistakenly show me a profile, I swipe it (either way), and then show me the exact same profile (which sometimes ends up meaning I get matched with someone I had swiped left) this is a great app. The pool of people (at least the men) used to be far, far better (""quality"" wise) than Tinder, however, since becoming more popular, the pool of people is obviously growing & making it a lot more hit or miss.  C'est la vie."
Greg McCoy,"Every message is just ""Hey."" If a guy said that on Tinder, he wouldn't get a response."
David Watson,full of fake profiles just like tinder
Alvaro Jimenez,You get more matches in Tinder
Vega punk,as compared to tinder. But I think this one has more potential
Anthony Raya,"Pretty sure it's a lot of fake profiles. I didn't get a match for the first few weeks (even when I'd do 100% right swipes for an entire day), and when I wrote feedback to the developer that I thought my match notifications might be broken, I quickly got 2 matches that were clearly fake profiles...I've matched with enough bots on Tinder to know how they talk. It's a cool idea, but I think they went the Ashley Madison route and made a bunch of fake profiles and chat bots to rope in the desperate dudes."
Esther Klann,"Told me there was noone around, when I tried to look for women. Deleted it rightaway. — update to your reply. Thank you. I know about changing the filter and I had tried that before deleting the app. That didn't help me. But there are plenty of gay/bi women on Tinder and on Her. So these would be the apps I'd recommend for same sex dating. Tinder and Her. Not Bumble. I'm sorry, it's not working for me."
Adam Mikulis,"Most of the profiles in this app are blank or extremely generic, but they must be getting right swipes or else I assume Bumble wouldn't be showing them. Please change the algorithm to show less profiles that haven't even been filled out. On the plus-side, the women are generally more attractive than on Tinder."
Kimberly Harris,"Good dating app... Any issues I have are with the men and not the app. It's hard to find the right one, and there are still those who get this app confused with Tinder. But I'm glad this app gives me local guys to see if there is a connection!"
Jason White,"A lot of women match but don't message but it's better than Tinder. Don't believe people who say it's fake, I've had 400+ matches and 200+ conversations and I'm ugly!"
Toby James,I get a lot of replies from Tinder and I mean a lot!!!  but with bumblebee very very few people replying back I'm starting to question some of the people that are on this app some do not  look real and I mean by fake pictures  and some accounts don't even look real at all but I have yet to meet anybody but I did speak to a few people.  I kind of see where you're going with idea of  ladies first reply but I think that kind of kill some of the fun. The truth is most girls won't first approach a guy..
Travis Dencker,"Its a simple app, just swipe, match, and message.  The service is where they are lacking most.  You have to get used to swiping through 20+ fake profiles before you can start seeing real people.  They reset your swipes at least once a month.  People you have already swiped R/L on pop back up throughout the month.  The 200 character about me section is too restrictive.  The one good thing I have found is that the bot count is less than that of Tinder or similar apps.  For men it doesn't have an alternative way of expressing interest beyond swiping or extending a match."
Jonathan Maybaum,I haven't really used anything else because nothing else impressed me. Grateful to have a good alternative to Tinder!
Justin Cardoza,"It would be fantastic if it worked in practice. One app-breaking problem is that most women are still afraid to actually make the first move. The other major problem is that the app will almost always delete your new matches within a few minutes. Until that's fixed, there's not much point in using it. I've uninstalled it from my phone because it's basically useless. You're better off with Tinder, folks."
richard anderson,Better than tinder
luxe babe,Very nice selection.. Makes tinder look like the clearance rack at the thift store
Shawntay Ward,"My cousin told me about the app so I joined and found that it is a bootleg version of Tinder. The only difference is that I initiate the conversation. What I found really ridiculous is that on my 1st day of being on the app, there were no more men for me to choose from within 3 hours. I live in Maryland so the radius would also cover DC and Virginia. You can't be serious!"
Wom Mll,"Who knows how the algorithm works but it's far worse than tinder.1-2 matches max over several weeks of use, as opposed to  10-15 on tinder over the same period, or 2 a week on badoo."
r Long,Same profile on Tinder has been very successful
M T,"Matches are few and far between. I like the concept of women initiating conversation. That way I know she's actually interested before spring time on witty banter. More limited pool than tinder. I have a buddy who's really good looking. He gets dozens of matches. I'm not so much, I get very few matches. I also like the character limit. It forces people to be creative."
メサダステｲン,"Faster results than Tinder gave me, though it's dependant on the girls/matching system. Many more girls that caught my interest however."
Ashley Elaine,A lot more hotter guys on here than tinder!
Ginny Tilby,"Better than Tinder, classier guys, easy to use. Thanks Bumble! Already been on a great date with a great man! Wish there were more filtering options."
Richard Abi-Rached,Requires less time than Tinder& less fakes but needs 48 hour window! App def tailored to the unemployed with time on their hands
SQH,"I've spent a month on this app trying to understand what makes guys join. I realize that the men who are on this app are the same type of men who never buy you flowers, forget your birthday, and are poor communicators. I have initiated convos with about 80% of my matches and less than 20% respond. The men on here are either extremely arrogant...have 0 self confidence... or just use this as an easier way to ask if youre DTF. I’ve walked away from most convos feeling less empowered then on Tinder."
Andrew Vanderpool,At least on Tinder I have people and bots trying to scam me out of my credit card number.
Colin Strylowski,Tons better than Tinder
Olivier Urban,"You guys have something really messed up with this app. At first I loved the interface, it was a nice change from Tinder. However after a few minutes on my galaxy S6, the notification on how to backtrack pops up every 2 seconds. I have to press the back key and quickly make my decision to swipe right or left before that stupid message pops up again. I will be deleting this app and going back to Tinder I guess. Really disappointed."
rob horton,App is lame! It's the same as tinder but only the women can start a conversation (only within 24 hours)
Jeremy Clark,"Much better app than Tinder! Easier to use; with the ""Queen Bees"" instigating the conversations, this seems to be have better potential to find connections."
Gareth Mc Mahon,ye good reminds me of tinder but still havnt a match yet 😑
Chris Jolley,"I was admittedly skeptical upon hearing they shared some staff with Tinder, an app that is astonishingly badly developed. I'm pleased that Bumble devs know what QA is. The wait was hard, but thanks for bringing this to Android! No complaints! EDIT: App runs, but they changed what set them apart from Tinder. Now men have to reply to replies within a day or matches expire. Now I get a ton of ""hi"" messages, putting the ball back in my court. Back to Tinder!"
Giovonnii Austin,"It's an ok app, lots of women but I get nothing back as to replys, i usually have some success with tinder but here I get nothing."
Anthony Hurtado,"I wish it had a super like option. Also, many photos I can upload to tinder I couldn't here. Don't know why."
Miranda Stahn,I read about bumble on a news article and was intrigued. I had never really had a good experience with Tinder so I signed up for Bumble just to chat with no expectations of meeting anyone. First thing I saw it attracts a very different male audience than Tinder (yes a few x-over profiles exist) but in general the guys on Bumble seemed more interested in connection above all else. No cheesy pick up lines just alot of good conversation. However the ap is tech flawed doesn't work on wifi and exhausts data.
brandon Ibes,I feel like no one even uses this. Even on tinder i got matches from bots :/
Russell Higgins,"Can't put my phone down, it's so much easier and more fluid than Tinder."
Ranjan Lamichhane,So much better than Tinder
Zepha Bali,"I am usually on board with ideas like this. Giving more power to women is usually an amazing idea. Unfortunately I think this app has been a bust for me. I have used this app for a couple weeks now and have yet to even obtain a single match. I am curious as to why, considering I tend to get an abundance of matches on OKC and Tinder. For now, I'll give this two stars until something actually happens."
Kyle Frederick,Less riff raff than tinder
Ryan Bickford,"I've been on both tinder and okcupid for around 2 years in this area and I can say there's no way all of these women exist. I see overlap between tinder and okcupid constantly (girls have accounts on both), but not here. The the photos that pop up are professionally taken.                                EDIT: As of July 2016 this is still true. Google 'bumble fake profiles' and find the reddit thread. Lots in agreement. This is app is clearly fraudulent.. not sure how it's allowed to exist in this state."
Jake Bennett,"The app is great - the 24 hour timer to start chatting really seems to spur on conversations. I've had a few technical issues, but support has been great at getting back to me. There are far fewer users than on Tinder, but doesn't seem to be any spam! (Yet)"
Cody Messner,"I have had only like 6 matches, and all were under par. . .on tinder I can't swipe right without instantly matching. I should get more than 1 match a day with my looks, as vain as that sounds. . .there might be a bug that needs fixed for android users."
A Google user,It is much better than tinder
Gabriel Kay,Really impressed with this app. I really like the concept of women having to make the first move. On top of that the UI for this app is fantastic. Tinder could learn a thing or two from Bumble
Brian Zas,"Seriously, this app is a waste of time... Stick with Tinder. As much as I like being matched with very attractive successful woman, I don't. I like real people, not professional photos taken of top level executives, CEOS, and high profile woman. I I think in like 200 swipes, I encountered 1 normal down to earth chick."
Paul Newcomb,I assume because ive been in the states where the number of users is bigger. However in other countries the app isnt so famous so it doesnt have a big pool. Invest in advertisement and soon this app will outdo tinder
Michael Niven,Tinder is better.
Matilda,More serious people than on tinder. Cute bees. What more do you want?  🐝
Andrew Guida,I've been using this for a few months now. I've gotten two matches. They were both identical profiles and sent identical messages never to respond again. I've met more quality people on tinder. That's kind of pathetic.
Daniella,Tinder 2.0
Sarah Melville,"The guys seem to be ok, definitely better than tinder. But I keep having to force stop this app. It's very frustrating. Super buggy"
Jessica Lau,"The idea of the app is great, just like Tinder but fewer spam accounts. Unfortunately, the app is not up to par. I have gotten matches and immediately gone to the messages section to message them, but in those two seconds the match disappeared, never to be seen again. If I do manage to message them, I've had the time out counter disappear (which seems to usually only happen when they respond), but receive no response message. Messages to support said only that they were aware of the problem."
Trey Capnerhurst,"The place where ppl go when Tinder has failed them.  Soooo. ..all the incredibly hot women, who are clearly tired of the abuse, and men who couldn't get a date. The design is improved over Tinder, including reporting, but the men still seem to confuse opening conversation with sexting, fetishizing, and abuse. Deleting this app after only one week. I can get just as disgusting misogyny  on my FB feed, without them thinking they can can try to date me. Nice BBF feature, if there were many ppl using it..."
tristan jones,"Tinder I get all kinds of responses. Here, not a single one. This app has all fake ppl. I'm no perfect 10. But I swiped on everyone to see. And nothing. Safe to say I am deleting and never returning. And I hope no one else ever downloads this garbage."
Jared Williams,Tinder has a lot of spam accounts now. I have not had any issues with spam on bumble yet.  Quality people pursuing happiness for the most part on this ap. Good work!
Zachary Cogan,Easy format and an all-round cleaner feel than Tinder.
Conor MacCarvill,"This is a great concept, and seems to have a decent amount of users. I really wish that the bio section was longer though, if I'm leaving the choice of talking to them, then I'd like some more room to tell them why they should message me. Seems strange to have a smaller word count than a tinder bio"
Red Many Hats prop.- Stumpwerx,"I think there needs to to be a database of population density for these apps non seem to work outside of metropolitan areas. 300,000 population in my city. Nothing same with tinder. Only thing this has over tinder is the women don't have Jesus all over their profiles."
Anthony Dupont,Basically a better Tinder. Just needs to be more popular.
Peter Boone,I like this app so far. Seems a little bit better than Tinder.
Ayyaz Mahmood,Just like tinder 90% of  them are bots plus never got a match
John Tyler,Better than tinder
RavMan IT,Don't really see the difference between this and tinder except the girl messages first. Not sure what that really accomplishes but the matches do seem more real
Savannah Kizachatéra,"Higher quality men then POF and tinder, mostly business professionals. Still has the hook-ups vibe if you swipe certain people but overall great layout. Love the friends only and women always contact first features. Profiles are verified with FB to cut down on catfishes and bots."
Sam J.,Not a single match since download....and i get matches all the time on tinder....i think the app is broken
Richard Hodgins,But women are less likely to send messages tinder is alot better than this
Kendra Winter,"Good concept and I like it better than tinder. But it'd be nice if maybe the app asked you if you're looking to hook up or actually date and matched you with those people so that you don't waste time talking to people who don't have the same intentions. I have been on some nice dates from this app though, as well as some not so nice ones. But definitely worth installing and checking it out"
Arturo Hernandez,I start using Bumble not knowing what I was getting into but I gotta say it's way better than Tinder because there's no Bots I have run into and it's real people
Ryan Mora,Very attractive girls and i haven't had a peoblem with any fake profiles. Way better than tinder
Ryan Van Dusen,"Been on this for like 4 days not a single connection, go on tinder get like 10 every day."
Joe Hoffman,"Good concept, needs work on swipe sensitivity.  It gets really frustrating on a Note to have to try four or five times to swipe a profile because I didn't manage to go completely across the screen.  Tinder's app is tuned much better."
Aldin tapia,Interesting concept however for me personally it doesn't work because like tinder swipes are mainly based on looks.
Daniel,"When it worked I went a month without a match or message.  Then it just quit working altogether.  Went back to Tinder and OkCupid and still get the flakey dates and horrible conversations, but at least they work...."
music fan,"Just like Tinder, but a smidge nicer."
Sheldon C,I love the concept and love the top down scroll. Else I'm seeing everyone from tinder. But I swipe away
Case G,"An absolutely polished idea. The UI is good, clean and easy on the eyes. Being a male, I'm very well past done having to message EVERY girl I come across just to wait forever and be denied by 90% of them so the fact that women HAVE to initiate conversation before things take off is pure gold. It's what Tinder needed to do but failed to. Easiest 5 star I've ever given."
Jessica Barnaby,Much better than tinder. Doesn't crash
Jeff Brown,Better than tinder
Mike Wallace,"Tinder is full of Bugs, this works perfectly for me. Not a fan of the woman must contact first concept. She already said yes, and many are shy or want the man to go first."
Andrew Corsberg,"Since this app, like Tinder, relies upon (mostly) superficial snap judgments, yet also includes a time limit, therefore the individual profiles should be ""recycled"". Often those snap judgments are fleeting and often influenced by environments and moods. I may ""like"" someone if exposed to them on Friday, but I may dislike them because I was exposed to that profile on a Monday. Consequently, myself and potential matches may miss out on the opportunity to connect."
Neil Basu,"I got two matches on the first day, so far so good.  Neither messaged me.  From then on, I swiped right a vast majority of the time, including girls who were not my type.  I'm using the same pictures that are getting some matches on tinder, so why am I getting absolutely no matches after going at it for days?  This app just seems like a waste of time that I could be wasting on tinder"
Bethany Ross,"This app does basically the same thing as every other site. I don't get how the woman starting the conversation makes the guys any more interested than someone on Tinder per say. I thought once I'd tried the app I'd notice a different calabria of men. Not so much. Same dudes differ swip.  Even if I am on bord with the ""I talk first"" idea, the 24 hr limit is unrealistic for someone with a life. And if you swipe more than one person, match eachother, you have basically a half a day, if that, to come up with several different witty conversation, bc saying 'hi' is un-inventive and unoriginal. My bad, I have minutes to respond bc I was, I dunno, sleeping through halfof my 24 hr allotted time and am just trying to keep the match. Then, after all that, the app messes up. Not notifying me of a message and then when try and respond,my match is available & no box pops up for me to write him back.  There should also be a section that allows you to check if any of the men you've swiped are still contenders. As in, if they pass on you, maybe ge/shedissapearsfrom your possibility section or something in that sense... just a thought. Otherwise, I'm now so over online dating, it's all the same."
Lindsay Fowks,"The description of the app does not say that you have to have Facebook but you do, and that's one of the reasons why I'm not on Tinder. I was hoping that Bumble would be different."
patrick bartley,"I really liked the app, but it was eating all of my data.  10x the usage of tinder 5x the amount from facebook.  Like the app but had to delete!!!"
Vanessa S,"When I get an alert that I have a match, I would say hello right away to start a conversation before 24 hrs is up. And as the day goes by... Zero response. So having the girl make the 'first move' doesn't matter. Might as well go back to using Tinder where the matches don't disappear on you. The rewind feature is great tho."
Joseph Scanlon,Seems to eliminate the problem tinder has with too many bots.  Needs more users.
J. H.,"Better than Tinder, still not perfect"
Andrew Garner,"Works like a female oriented Tinder clone.  Not a bad thing, no complaints here"
Michael Thibeault,Better than Tinder
matt turnquist,"First the UI is buggy, I have to make extended swipe motions. Lost conversations because of a time limit. It seems I have a very low swipe to match ratio especially compared to tinder where I get more matches even if I don't count the spam accounts. Read some of the girls ratings here saying all the guys are tools on this app, seriously stop going for the douche bags then. App seems like a good idea but it does not work like it seems"
Hakeem Ware,"Still new, but it's a very good step from tinder. If you want the top dating app everyone will be on soon get on Bumbler. I'm very pleased."
Andres Romualdo,Way better than Tinder.
Cierra Truss,I think the concept is good without the super sketchy-ness of Tinder.
Lindsey Lee,"I like this app, way better than tinder. But I don't like the latest update. Making it so people have to send a message in 24 hours or the match goes away? So stupid. Not everyone is glued to their phone and can respond constantly in a conversation. Make it the way it was before. I keep losing matches because of the new update."
V M,"Doesn't crash like Tinder always does, is more fun and easier to use, and since women start the conversations I find the quality of conversations ends up being better."
Jason Corona,"No matches after weeks, although maybe I missed my chance; they added that 24hr chat expire while I was camping over the weekend, so make sure you never do anything out of cell tower range I guess. I may not be a 10, but I got plenty of matches on Tinder after a few days. This app basically offers nothing but blurry pictures of pretty women and feelings of vague disappointment. If that sounds like the dating experience you're after, this is your app. Or alternately just go watch some free porn."
Gregory Jean,Différents de Tinder et compagnie
Thomas Tarrant,It definitely seems like the order in which profiles appear is inorganic and based on how many right swipes the people have historically received; I'm basing this on the fact that the average physical attractiveness of profiles on bumble seems much higher than those tinder (NOT a good thing since it relegates less-right-swiped users to the back of the pack)
Jared Enos,"It's not quite as buggy and doesn't crash frequently like tinder. Also seems to be where all of the pretty girls are at. And the choice is up to them, so it's low pressure."
K Windy,Better UI then tinder.
Gabrieljorama,Looks great and has way better navigation than Tinder. That being said: Women now have all the power in their hands to choose. It has not worked for me. Props to those who actually get picked.
Blaize S.,"It would be perfect if I actually received sound notifications.  Just like tinder in that I get no sound at all, so I have to pick up my phone way too much just to see when or if my ""bees"" have messaged LOL Also, maybe I'm old fashioned, but the man should speak first.  Just sayin'."
Stive Stivesy,"Nobody uses this app. I've had it a little over a week now. At first I used it like Tinder and swiped selectively as I was under the impression that there were other real users out there. After a week of no matches, I swiped positively for EVERYONE for several minutes until the app literally told me that I was ""out of people."" The next day I got ONE match who didn't even show up in my pending tab. Maybe I'm not the best looking guy, but at least I  get SOME matches on Tindr. Nothing but dead profiles here."
Me Me,A cheap tinder knock off with no people
james bentley,"Unlimited swiping of beautiful ladies who are way outta my league. The normal woman are mostly professional, which I like & not covered in tats; so there's hope for regular guys.  The app is easy to use, but has less text characters for the profiles than Tinder.  I prefer the open OkC model; words matter.  Love the send a pic function, it eliminates asking for a phone number, but idiots will misuse it. Hate the limited text area to see and navigate for proofreading.  24hr waits haven't been good to me."
MaXx Amillion04,"Great concept, it's gonna be hot if this hits the millions in users,  because I think it's a better app than the competition(tinder, etc), but data is an issue. If you are rapid-firing through profiles,  it loads tons of images/profiles at once and gouges your mobile data. Just to be kept in mind"
Pouya Mohammadi,"I saw same girl over 3 times. Its all fake. There is no real girls and this app just has nice pictures, if you want to meet in similar way you can go to tinder."
Jim Smith,"In reality, each person should be able to initiate a conversation, but then it's just tinder so I've uninstalled and gone back there. I'm not sure how they market to women but it seems that they all are basically the same on here, at least in my age range. Tinder has way more diversity but that could be due to its time on the market."
Karan Singh,"Would get lots of matches on Tinder, but a week on bumble and literally not one."
Hayley Harness,"I can barely figure out how to work it, plus all I got was guy options. I'm not on it to pick up guys. I need friends. Not some buffed out jerks who think they are better than me. If I wanted to only see guy options I would go back to being treated like a ho on tinder. Not on an app apparently made for women."
Candice Johnson,"I love that the men are more attractive than Tinder. However, I've set my distance to 15mi and it constantly shows me people 20-40mi away. NOT what I want and a huge downfall."
Joe Mitchell,"There are loads of absolutely gorgeous pics on here. I have a hard time believing they're all real profiles. Also, after a month of use I've had 2 matches. I installed tinder yesterday and have had 4 so far. Seems fishy to me."
Richard McMurray,"I like the concept that bumble has, I it's better than tinder because it makes the matches you get seem better and helps eliminate the numbers game on the male side of things. Also, instead of limiting the number of likes and re-showing profiles, the one and doneness is actually pretty refreshing."
Bob M,"Better than tinder, hinge, coffee... by a huge margin!  Give all the power to the girls, fantastic!  They can keep it classy and no stress on anyone because of the rules given by the app. The app also works very well too. A massive plus. No crashes, glitches or any slowdown at all."
Chris Jubinsky,Better then Tinder
Samuel Post,Better then tinder
corey richey,Why make someone swipe if they can't message them when they match. What is the point of guys swiping? Every guy swipes right 100% of the time anyway. Why not just let guys choose from women who already chose them? It's like you cloned all of tinder but only improved it for women.
A Google user,Much much better than tinder in app quality. Tinder used to fail and close constantly Bumble does not. Also the quality of women just seems much better. Maybe it's this model of women making the first move that's provoking some efficacy?
Matthew Moore,"The only difference between this and Tinder is that more girls on here have an excessive amount of makeup on. Also you have to physically swipe, which gets to be much when there's an endless onslaught of party clowns.  On another note, what do you do if you don't have a facebook account?"
luis vargas,"Although it might provoke people from saying you copied Tinder this apps needs some like and dislike ""buttons"". The swipe is sometimes really laggy and unstable. Also get some glitches when you swipe and move the picture, and someone else appears after you move the picture. This app would be a lot better if the developers refine the GUI. Thanks."
N Azhari,"Expecting  women to message first is a disaster, second off,  the friend zone option just killed this app for men,  back to tinder for dates and hookups,  thanks"
Ryan Peschges,This app is awful. The concept is cool but the practicality is unrealistic. This app is just soley for ladies. There are no girls that will start a conversation unless you are a very good looking dude. Poor tinder knock off.
Brandon Flickinger,Cleaner and more elegant than tinder. Boots faster and never crashed or lagged once.
Gerson Galeano,Easy to use. Better interactions than tinder
Patrick Molina,Been swiping and swiping and swiping. Still no matches. I used the same bio I use on Tinder and still no matches. Uninstalling
Justin R,Better looking ppl than tinder! Great selection in my area
David Harper,"Better than Tinder. Quality of women is good, but I wish it would let you undo a swipe. I've accidentally swiped left or right a couple of times."
Matt Gentile,"The app is somewhat odd. I like that it doesn't restrict how many times you can swipe, like Tinder. But all the women on here are gorgeous, like how are they not taken already?? Another issue is that I've swiped right 98% of the time and only 1 match. Now I'm not the best looking guy out there, but I must have gone 300 women on there now and only 1???? Something is off.."
C A-S,"Basically this is a tinder clone, it works better on an app level, I get the empowerment idea behind women asking first.But the user base is poor, noone fills in the""about you""section no one and if they do they put in stupid emojis like 💩🐤🎉 I mean what are you supposed to gleam about a woman from that except she's illiterate? If you're not writing about you then you are asking people to judge you on your looks only and if I'm swiping no, because you obviously don't care who likes you unless they are""Hot"""
Ryan Becerra,First fail- tinder had the worst (and I mean worst) cropping tool I had ever seen. Then bumble came along and took the title. How you don't fix that or make it more useful when this apps focal point is for a contact to see a picture(not even a bio)  is beyond me.      2nd- what's the difference? Girls message first? That's it? Create something to stand out. Tinder had moments  then took them away even though people loved them. Do something like that. Otherwise it's just a sad knockoff of tinder
Andrew Mayne,"The girls I match with tend to be higher quality than on tinder, and the girl messaging first means less wasted time on women who aren't actually interested in talking."
Chanty,"The app definitely needs some work, half the time you don't receive the notifications. The concept does not work. I'm 25, good looking, yet half of the matches do not respond. I think people who've done the tour on Tinder come on here after, already bored and not looking to meet. I wouldn't waist my time on here"
Brandon Johnson,Better layout than Tinder
Roland Cleaver,"Nice idea bumlbling through the tumbleweed and they desperately need seed the app with some girls. Try a PR blitz with Cosmo, Marie Claire or whatever. Note that this is casting the net wider than on Tinder, PoF or OKCupid. STOP PRESS: I have mail, so an extra star. :-D YMMV"
Christopher Peters,Just another dating app.  Exact copy of Tinder
Tina Cooper,"Used to be on Tinder, much better, hard to believe I know, but that's how it is, had about 5 pics to look at lol won't bother again."
Alex Ponebshek,"At least on tinder there are short profiles.  Bumble is just pics.  On the off chance a woman actually messages you, who knows if you have any common interests."
Alan Schoen,"Bumble started out pretty well for me, but then it got really weird.  For the first couple weeks, I matched with women who were very interesting to me.  They were a little more shy and reclusive than the girls I meet on Tinder.  I talked to a few, and I met one who I am still seeing pretty regularly. But at some point, Bumble stopped showing me real women, and started showing me fake-looking profiles.  They look more like ads for erotic services than actual dating profiles.  This has turned me off to the app, and I'm thinking about deleting it now."
Jesse Kissee,"I like the idea of this app, but it's worse than tinder. You have to be extremely attractive to get a match in my experience. It seems the only women I see are extremely attractive as well. Is it throwing away the less attractive people and not even showing everyone every possibility?"
Sam Cotton,I like that this app is different than tinder while keeping the swipe right / left rhythm still a thing.
Joe Petruzzelli,Giving women the responsibility to initiate takes what tinder did one step further.
ANNIE DYBERG,"I like that this app put women in charge, but guys don't respond even though they liked you. So just like tinder this app seems to be a bust."
Andrew Stewart,"As I scroll through the reviews, I see the fields saturated with men...this is why bumble was created...because all of these guys bombing the women. It gives women an opportunity to choose who will spam them. If you dont like it...go back to tinder. Its a great app, and I like knowing that when I get a message, there is a high probability that an actual conversation will follow. Once you have been messaged, its up to you to keep them interested...no different than any other online dating service. 2 thirst.."
Scott Bialor,"I do pretty well on Tinder I got stupid jokes for days and a solid profile. And most of the girls on bumble are SPECTACULAR, seriously. But it's been over a month of occasionally going on and swiping with reckless abandon and haven't gotten A SINGLE MATCH. The idea is good and the app runs smoothly but the female users seem to have incredibly unrealistic expectations."
Jacob J.,"App is far superior looking than Tinder.  Photos ""pop off"" the page and the details area is uniquely available with a simple click. I like swiping up to view more photos.   Using the app itself was boooooring. Maybe because of my area or because women in my area don't use it the way Bumble creators had hoped.  Speaking with women at a singles mixer recently, many said they had profiles but used it less often than Tinder. ""Too much work""   Once a match is formed, if ""she"" doesn't send a message within 24 hours you have an ability to pay to keep the connection open another 24 hours. Whose to say she will?   I got 2 connections but no conversations after 3 months of usage.  Terrible odds. Back to real life singles events for me."
Don Lindenborn,"After trying out bumble, I will never use tinder, hinge or any of the other dating apps again. Bumble seems to draw a more professional and mature crowd than the others mentioned. Also, not having to start with some crappy pick up line every time you meet someone is nice. I highly recommend anyone who is looking for a fresh start with online dating to give bumble a shot. You will come away impressed."
Tom Wilkinson,Well designed interface. Corrects a couple of complaints about tinder. Takes the chance on having girls go first... Which pays off
Kevin Dixon,One day of swiping and I got a date the next. F tinder it works.
Timothy Bjurquist,Just like Tinder but no fake profiles (yet) and the women HAVE to message you first which is kinda cool.
Ty Blake,Great app...better than tinder
C A,"Nothing has come of it, use tinder instead"
Respond Code3,"Women I've met off other sites have shown me their inbox, and they are literally getting hundreds of messages a day from guys. Which is why I never bother to send the 1st message. I'll just reply to who ever messages me. This app is perfect since the female has to message you first. Unlike tinder where people match and don't talk. So far every single woman who has matched with me except one has initiated the convo. It's only been less then a day but I'm loving this app. Women who actually talk."
corey benson,"This ap could be the next Tinder. So far, it's failing. Fix the 'no network connection' amongst other things.."
Tamarr Purdom,Tinder on steroids lol
Suzie Parr,"It bothers that I  constantly matched with people just visiting my location.  I am looking for a relationship, not a hook up....if I wanted that I would go to Tinder or POF"
Eric Hinz,"1) Accounts are FAKE 2) The remaining legitimate accounts are not used anymore, therefore no response back 3) In the very rare chance a girl messages you after a match, she could just put ""hey"" and her end of the deal is done with no further communication. 4) I have concluded that the concept is good, but severely flawed. Though it's an ego boosting app like Tinder, at least I would use their app first to actually get some conversation."
Chris Ochs,Much better than Tinder
Manny Bee,"At first I was against the whole ""women first"" thing. Then, I remembered the amount of time spent on Tinder coming up with witty openers only to get a stale reply or no reply at all (after hundreds of matches, this was the main case). This app is great because it cuts out the attention seeking; women are more picky on their matches because they have to start the convo. Sure, that means less matches but it also means less time wasted. Quality of women is also x10 better than Tinder, with less bots too!"
Chris Sterza,I know what this app is intended for and I understand there are a lot of creeps on tinder but there's definitely a better method for dealing with them than silencing a whole gender. It's sexist and insulting for both genders. It insinuates that a majority of guys are creeps and the good ones need to be weeded out and also that women are not able to initiate a conversation on their own and need to be forced to do so. What these dating apps need is an easy way to report creeps and a team dedicated to banning.
Tyler Kane,10 times better than tinder.  Forces women to talk to you rather than collect men for their ego.  Actually met women on here rather than tinder.  Like the fact you can send pics in the chat
Hunter Dennis,"I use both Tinder and Bumble. First, I would like to point out that there has to be fake profiles on here or something. Also there isn't enough people on this app. Although Tinder is more popular, this app lets you do little things that Tinder does not. You can reorder your photos on your profile (something Tinder will not let you do). Another example is that you don't have to click on their card to swipe through their pics. You can simple swipe up and down. Just makes it a lot simpler."
D Vialpando,"Great concept but I would say that ladies aren't aggressive enough to have all the control. By far the least amount of activity out of ANY dating app I've used (compared to Tinder, OKC, and POF)."
R F,"Dating pool in Australia a bit limited, otherwise this is a great concept and better than Tinder IMHO."
Lj LaValle,Funny how they front load all the good looking people first each time you surf through all of the profiles. Most profiles look like glamour shots - hard to believe they are legit - only 2 responses in the last week with no follow ups - time waster - Tinder is way better - deleting this crap.
Paul Aitken,Why do I get constant tinder matches and no matches on here?
jonblazeinc,"I like it very similar to tinder but a lot more hotter women,  quite surprised by the amount of quality women on here....early days though I'll wait to see if matches gives silent treatment like a lot on tinder do"
Alexander Hamrick,The tech behind this application seems pretty sweet. Not only that but the concept is really cool. The problem I have is the match percentages are worse than tinder or most other dating apps. Not sure if that is just the pool that use the app or what.
Peter Hahn,"Something about the rules in bumble and the fact that ladies go first seems to encourage classier women than tinder and fosters less of a hookup environment than tinder, in my opinion."
Ryan Stott,Functionality is a million times better than tinder
Joshua Silva,Simple and user friendly. Better than Tinder that's for sure.
Tony Villar,Better than Tinder across the board
Josh Grabiec,Easy to use like the differences from tinder.
Mike Tsho,"So first thing I noticed is this app doesn't run like total garbage whilst also draining my battery. Tinder is the absolute opposite. This app also doesn't FREAK OUT when I put my phone in landscape mode to type. Tinder completely resets the app.  Also, the people on here aren't as trashy"
J P,"I guess they all can't be like Tinder, but it's free. Definitely wouldn't pay money for it."
Andrew Raynier,"It's like the good old version of Tinder with unlimited swipes, and no robots so far."
c dubbs,I had tinder for a day and then got this app. Everyone is less creepy and more and more chill
Aubrey Modium,"No diversity, no connections,  and once l connected app won't load or doesn't show. Not feeling this one worse than the recycled girls on tinder."
Graeme Crawley,"Love the idea behind the app and the app interface itself. However, I feel like it's not as fluent to use as most high quality apps available today. For example:   switching back and forth between conversations and matches can sometimes take about 3-5 seconds.   I know it's not much, but from a user standpoint my immediate thought was ""this is slower than Tinder"". Love the app though."
Cassandra Geneve,"Super easy to use,  the notification system is super great! Way better than Tinder"
A Google user,Would be 5 stars but there are still a few hiccups Ive noticed. For people who want more than just a phone game [tinder]
Jessica Lewis,It's easy to use and I would choose this over tinder any day!
William Alexander,It let's you have a couple likes the first time but after that you only get 1 or 2 if you are lucky. And then it won't tell you if you had any matches in your log after you get a notification saying that you had one.  Just use tinder since it actually works. This is a good concept but a horrible app.
Josh Dorfman,"Great concept and I agree with the style of matching and and all, but there are multiple complaints of which I agree with. Ive had it for over 2 months and still have not received a single match. I mean I have received one but when I checked there wasn't anybody there on my matches. So far, Tinder and Meet Me are the best options."
A Google user,Girls are more attractive than Tinder. But no prospect yet :-)
Sarah Pinach,Love this app. Only suggestions for improvement would be linking up the Instagram like tinder and it drives me nuts that the text box doesn't expand when you type.
Anna K,"I dont know what everyones talking about, my network connection is fine. The men here are a lot more better looking then tinder. I dont like the part that when you get a match they cant speak or hold a conversation other then that lol its a cool app"
bradley brewer,it's essentially tinder with less spam and the ladies message you.
Travis Rowitsch,Its like everything tinder should be. This app works soooo much better. I highly recomend.
Ryan Deocampo,"There's a lot to like with this app compared to tinder. It's less cluttered since the photos take up the whole screen. Left swipe, right swipe. You can also share photos which is nice. Can't do that on tinder. My biggest gripe is that there are no light notifications. It's a bit harder to have a live conversation without those since you would have to constantly check you phone to see if they message you back. Ultimately though I think the main concept is flawed. Women make the first move? Nahhh."
A Google user,So much better than tinder
angryman1011,Better quality users than tinder
Bikat Uprety,"The most boring dating app. Maybe I'm just ugly but normally have enough success on Tinder... basically,  it takes ages to match and once you do the girls almost never speak to you so the matches expire. Verdict: boring and waste of time"
Konnor Scanlon,"Pretty good interface, good idea, nice alternative to tinder"
Everett Guenther,You might as well just use Tinder its functionally the same and has so many less fake accounts
Matt Buckley,Good alternative to Tinder.
Richard Favazza,"After the first day of having the app, the most people I can see per day is about 5. And seemingly no matches even though I get at least one a week on tinder."
Andrew G,Much better than Tinder
Smith,Not getting nearly as many matches on here than I get on Tinder maybe that's normal. Seems nice though.
Axel Escarcega,"Either the swiping function requires a certain flicking technique that I don't possess or it's just messed up. When I try to swipe left or write, the picture either moves a little then snaps back into place, or skips to a random person. I swiped right on people I didn't want to match with, which led to awkward situations. I give it a 3 because I like the premise of giving people a deadline to talk. Tinder is more about stroking your ego with how attractive your matches are than actual conversation."
Nimesh Dave,If your reading this you have played youself.....again......and if your still reading its tinder....ikr the app development companies juat went and made another one 🔑
David Brown,"Great concept, and flawless app. Way better than other dating apps! Looking at you Tinder..."
Justin Collins,"The functionality is great, performance wise it works more smoothly than Tinder or Hinge on my Note 4, UI is basically identical to Hinge and Tinder so ease of use is familiar and easy. I have had better conversations on here than on other apps and it's nice to know the girl is interested in me first. I find it funny that girls have confessed they feel a bit intimidated trying to think of what to say first. Lol This will potentially help women understand the pressure that is on us men!"
Sewwandi Madigapola,I like it better than Tinder
Jeff,"Either the girls who downloaded this don't use it, they're fake profiles of Facebook users used to populate an empty app,  or they're a thousand times pickier on this than they are on other similar apps which makes this worthless. Perhaps because they're the ones who have to start the conversation, girls are being supremely choosy and only want to start a chat with the absolute top tier of guys. I've got more matches on tinder than I know what to do with, but as of right now this app is a pure waste of time"
Jack Eastes,An elite version of tinder
Anastasia Mark,"I find Tinder super glitchy, bumble works great."
Derrick Mason,Just the new tinder
Michael Glass,"I like this as a Tinder alternative, though there are fewer users on it at the moment. It sucks, I've matched with a decent amount of girls and none of them have replied before their time limit ran out."
DJ Smith,I like the overall idea of it... much better than tinder
Charles Paul Harris-White,"I doubted this app, but on the first day I found a couple of cute girls that messaged me back! One of the girls was someone I had a crush on a decade ago, but I missed the opportunity to ask her out back then. On okcupid and tinder, women can choose from a few to hundreds of messages a day to respond to, meaning a lot of guys never get a response or their messages disappear in all those messages. This is way better. Less clutter, and if a girl likes a guy, she can simply say hi."
David Liddelow,Its easier to upload photos here than on tinder. Just needs more people.
Alex Sokolof,"Apps great. Girls have to message first, sometimes they don't, sometimes they do. If they do they are usually down to chat which leads to meeting up. I think it makes it easier while weeding out some of the bullshit you find on tinder"
Michael Z,Whyvis this another Facebook only app. Don't have tinder for that reason. I don't want a Facebook just to go on a app
Devin Capps,Made me realize how boring most chicks are. Very few actually try to impress with a solid opener. App is still cool though. Not a bunch of fake profiles like Tinder.
Amber S,"Only experienced one glitch otherwise app is 100x better than Tinder since they have all the ridiculous updates. Just which guys would use it for dating and not hooking up. Also a lot of men don't respond, which makes the matches list cluttered. Give men 24 hours to respond to our message, just like how we have 24 hours to start a conversation. Also adding a search button on the matched list would be great so we could find who we're looking for without scrolling way down."
Love4all2015 Hh,"Better than tinder. I love the fact that men are more attractive, you can send individual pics to specific men, and I go on dates quicker. I'm a 33 yr old Caribbean American woman that only dates white men. I get many matches and responses back here in Nyc. Men here with reviews that are mad about no responses, it's because you're not attractive enough. That's the real reason. Women that are upset, men are not attracted to you as well. Of course, some men dont say ""Hi"" back to me, but so much more men do."
Harry Lyman,"Maybe there is something wrong with android users, but I have zero messages after 5 weeks. I'm no dweeb either. Hate to be cocky but I'm a good looking, well rounded guy with a career and get hit up all the time on tinder and okc by attractive girls. Something is wrong with the app."
Brad Fayett,I do fine getting hot matches on tinder yet I've been swiping through this app for a week now every chance I get and haven't gotten a single match. I find that hard to believe. Also you get a lot of swipes the first time you use the app then every day after that you get like 2 swipes then ur out of people. I'm about to delete this app its a waste of time. Its unfortunate because the women look a lot higher quality than on tinder
Ricky Nguyen,"Let's just say all the other dating apps work better. . . Because they do and I've tried them.    Tinder, okc even grinder"
Annalise Nicholson,App works fine for the most part. But the premise just doesn't work. Dudes don't want girls to make the first move. They lose interest or blow you off. Just made me feel like crap about myself. Tinder might suck but at least people follow through. Months on this app and not one actual date
Brandon Corbett,"I love the idea of women messaging first. But the android app feels funky. Contrary to some, I don't believe *every* profile is a fake. But it does feel like a few might be planted. I can't say if it's similar to the camgirl bots on Tinder, but it leads me to my next problem: many of my matches are not women I've actually swiped right on. Some are, but I get random matches from girls that I would never consciously swipe right. Maybe they're mistakes, but there's been too many to call it a coincidence."
Brent Grablachoff,"Great app. Way cuter talent pool versus Tinder. Got a decent amount of matches and messages. Only problem I've had is consistently the app doesn't work right on 4G LTE, it only works properly on WiFi. And all other apps including Tinder work fine. The matches honeycomb keeps loading and many times photos of the matches don't show up. Strange. Please fix."
Seita Goto,I love the simplicity of this app. I've always found it weird on Tinder that you have to tap on the photo then swipe left to view the person's photos.  I accidentally swiped left on so many people from trying to see more of their pictures. The up and down swiping is a great solution that is no longer for an option for the other app because of Super Likes. Lot of people here seems to be complaining about back end issues but I don't know if they're true. If it is true hope you guys can sort that out soon.
Kyle Grenon,"I just installed and seems to work just fine so far, people actually talk so better than tinder"
Larry Henson,Tinder wannabe that fails drastically.
Tryksta 724,"Yes, the women are significantly more attractive than Tinder and yes, the app requires them to speak first. They still find a way to play games. I rarely match and when I do, it usually expires or in the few convos I've actually had, at some point they stop talking. What good is looking at attractive people if nothing can get off the ground?"
Tim Day-Lewis,"I matched with several girls, but they never message first. I mean, if the whole idea is to ""give girls the power"", why don't they message? If they didn't like what they saw to begin with, Swype left! I'm having MUCH better luck on tinder...      ...thinking I'll uninstall soon"
P Dub,"Went out on about 8 dates on tinder, all a good time but to be honest..  None of them really looked like their pics. There's no doubt a lot more to choose from on tinder and I get way more matches but the quality of women is significantly better on Bumble. This last date off Bumble was the hottest, most interesting and actually looked like her pics! My matches are physically more attractive on Bumble and I've messaged with all of them that initiated. Not sure why so many people are having issues... Ugly?"
Paolo Francesco,"Issue: they haven't crossed the line from being just an ""I think you're physically attractive"" app to being one that can actually connect two people. The app prides itself on being better than tinder, but the power girls have is minimal, and the method just leads to less interaction. Bumble still forces you to make a quick, shallow decision based on looks. What's the point, and how is this any better? There is no filter for shallow people, individuals you would not be compatible with."
Jake Crossley,"I'll be lucky if I can swipe through two profiles before it says I'm out, and rarely do I get matches. Not to be conceited but I do just fine on tinder and usually match easily. On the contrary I have a friend who can swipe through for hours and gets a normal amount of matches... There is something SERIOUSLY WRONG with this app. Its worthless and a waste of time."
Moon,"Lol. :( how many of the profiles are active? The women are gorgeous, successful. But I get little to no swipes on here compared to tinder!"
James Demastus,"Lot of prostitute spam on this app, like tinder"
Walter Woods,"Yay.  A slightly less tinder-like tinder.  In practice, this doesn't pan out too well.  Neat idea, but a step back in terms of scumminess.  Since only women can message first, there is zero incentive for guys not to right swipe everyone and see who messages.  They also burden users (males anyway) with a ton of fake profiles, which makes it hard to take anyone on this app seriously.  Try Coffee Meets Bagel instead if you want something new, I like that one much better."
Trish Dieudonne,Tinder was getting ridiculous. The last straw was when the decided to completely kill the app with that last update removing the moments. Thank goodness bumble is now available for Android. It gives a nice fresh spin on dating apps.

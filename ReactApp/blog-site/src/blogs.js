      "content":"I started my programming journey when I was in secondary school. Back then, I joined an Infocomm club and I started to learn Scratch, a versatile drag-and-drop tool that teaches me simple logic flow, data conditioning and simple iteration loops. It got me so interested in programming that I spent hours making a flight simulator on Scratch.\n\nI was so into programming that I took the computing class for my GCE O Levels. There, I started learning my first real programming language and that was Python. I was learning data structuring, the basics of networking, functions and classes and much more. My computing teacher gave my classes a series of programming questions in a gamified manner. Each time we got an algorithm correct, we were awarded points. My friends and I will spend time after school trying to outdo each other.\n\nWith the experience I had, and the opportunities I was given, I decided to pursue a career in programming. I am currently studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I am currently in my 3rd year and I am looking forward to my final year project and internship opportunities.",

      "content":"My learning experience in StackUp has been phenomenal so far, altho i have missed some of the campaigns during my exam weeks but other than that it has been good. I have benefitted alot from learning basic JavaScript and FireBase deployment campaign on StackUP. Altho most of the times I  end up submitting my quests late and in turn, i missed the seet $$$ at times (lol). Learning Version Control from StackUp has helped me get familiar with deployment on github and helped me understand version control really well :)))). But overall, I have learnt alot from StackUP and I am looking forward to more campaigns in the future. ",
